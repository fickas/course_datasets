(mr and mrs hays in b-69, thornton and orian davidson in b-71, their maid miss perreault in b-73 and hays secretary, vivian payne, in b-24).  one hour before the disaster, hays relaxed with colonel archibald gracie and captain edward crosby in the gentlemen's smoking lounge and they talked about the technological advances in transportation. at one point, hays conceded that while titanic was a superlative vessel, he expressed concern that ""the trend to playing fast and loose with larger and larger ships will end in tragedy."" twenty minutes later, titanic struck the iceburg. hays never believed the ship would sink quickly. as he put his wife and daughter into a lifeboat he assured them titanic would stay ""afloat for at least 10 hours.""

"HOPKINS, Mr Frederick William",14,Male,Crew,Southampton,0,0,0,"        frederick (fred) william hopkins was born in aldershot, hampshire, england in the latter half of 1897.  he was the son of alfred frederick hopkins (b. 1870) and letitia mary jones (b. 10 december 1875). his father was born in sheffield, yorkshire and came from a family with strong military links, whilst his mother was a native of cardiff, wales. the couple had married at aldershot on 16 september 1896.  fred’s father, who had over twenty years’ worth of military experience, had enlisted for service in the british army in october 1885 whilst in york, records showing that he was a diminutive man standing at only 5' 1"" tall (he later grew to 5' 8"") and with brown hair and hazel eyes and going on to attain an exemplary record of conduct. his service with the 3rd king's own hussars lasted on home soil until december 1898 when he was posted to india for a three-year service until 22 january 1901, with a spell in south africa and another in india until december 1906 after which he was posted home. it appears that his wife and family accompanied him for at least a period of this service. he was discharged from service at the rank of sergeant trumpeter on 3 january 1907.  fred had two siblings: his brother george was born in norwich, norfolk on 11 october 1898 whilst his younger brother ralph was born in lucknow, india on 25 april 1901.  the family would be absent from the 1901 census, then still stationed in india. by the time of the 1911 census fred's father was described as an army pensioner and caretaker for the offices of the white star line and the family were residents of 14 fanshawe street, southampton with fred still described as a schoolboy. he perhaps left school that summer and went to work at sea, his position possibly being secured by his father's connection to the white star line. fred was also a keen boy scout and was a patrol leader in the 20th southampton group, of which he was a popular member.  when fred signed-on to the titanic on 4 april 1912 he gave his address as 14 fanshawe street, southampton and his age as 16 (in reality he was several months shy of his 15th birthday). his previous ship had been the olympic and as a plate steward, he received monthly wages of £3, 15s. he was one of two 14-year-olds working on the titanic, the other being bellboy william albert watson, and therefore was one of the youngest members of the crew.

(1871-1938, later mrs dominic anthony edgar stuart palmer-stone), jessie helen mary (b. 1873) and richard marie (b. 1878).  he first appears on the 1881 census when the family were living at 6 eversley street, toxteth park. his father passed away in 1888 aged 44 and two years later, at age 16, hugh joined a roman catholic religious order, ""canons regular of the lateran,"" as a student for the priesthood. at that time the order's seminary was based at st mary's priory, bodmin, cornwall where st mary's roman catholic church is still situated today; he appears there at the time of the 1891 census. after only two years' study mcelroy decided that the priesthood was not for him and he left the priory in 1892 and returned to his home in liverpool where he followed his father by joining the merchant navy. he and his family appear on the 1901 census living at 6 wilton street, liscard, cheshire, where they had moved to the previous year, and hugh was described as a ship's purser.  during the boer war mcelroy served aboard the troopship britannic;

by 1903 he was purser aboard cedric and earning £15 per month and stating his address as hotel st george, liverpool. by 1906 he was back aboard majestic and still working aboard her until at least january 1907. he served aboard majestic and adriatic under the command of captain e. j. smith before he, alongside chief steward andrew latimer and surgeon dr norman o'loughlin were transferred to olympic.   he was married in ballymitty, co wexford, ireland over the summer on 9 july 1910 to barbara mary ennis (b. 18 may 1876) in a ceremony performed by his brother, father richard mcelroy. he was described as a purser for the white star company.  barbara ennis, born in liverpool, was the daughter of john ennis, jp and elizabeth taylor; her father, the manager of steamship company the allan line, was an irish catholic from co wexford. her family had relocated there sometime around the turn of the century and made their home at their estate, springwood, at tullycanna. john ennis was a sick man and was cared for by a resident nurse at his home which consisted of ten rooms and was run by domestic servants, his farming property also employed farmhands and a stableman.  hugh and his wife appear on the 1911 census living at the home of his father-in-law john ennis in tullycanna; they were and would remain childless. by early 1912 they were living at polygon house in southampton.   mcelroy signed on to the titanic on 9 april 1912 and as chief purser he could expect to earn a monthly wage of £20. before joining titanic hugh sent two postcards from the royal southampton yacht club, both were to his priest friends. one sent to phillip corr dated 6 april 1912 read as follows:  “many thanks for your letter and good wishes which i reciprocate, the “titanic” is in many ways an improved olympic and will i trust be a success, i am sorry i could not get down to swanage this time but i was tied to southampton and the train service too erratic to take chances, all kind of messages to you both”.  on the card, which still exists, a different hand had noted “coal strike time” against the reference to the train service and so the titanic sailed. the other card was to his friend cuthbert mcadam still in bodmin priory; this was also dated 6 april 1912 with a message in a similar vein.  on the 11 april 1912, before titanic sailed hugh and his wife barbara attended a special flying matinee in southampton at the hippodrome theatre to see the world-famous danish dancer mademoiselle adeline genee and after watching her performance they sent flowers backstage, which were in the danish national colours.  hugh had taken to babysitting a canary and it is alleged the animal sailed on the titanic and survived; it was owned by a mr meanwell who lived in france and who wanted to get his precious canary to cherbourg from england and asked mcelroy to do this.   apart from bruce ismay and captain smith, the only other officer who regularly dined with the passengers was mcelroy; renowned for his amiability and good sense of humour mcelroy appears to have been almost as popular with passengers as the captain and many timed their journeys so they could travel with him.  on the night of the 14-15 april 1912, hugh had spent an evening (as was his normal duty) in the first class dining saloon. many survivors reported seeing him during the evacuation.  steward samuel rule stated to the british inquiry  ""... as i passed up the staircase, i got to a deck and i saw mr mcelroy the chief purser, and mr dodd, the second steward. they were in deep conversation. i thought to receive some orders from them, but there were no orders given, and i passed on to the next deck, the boat deck.""   purser mcelroy was seen at boat 9 where he was assisting in the loading. first officer murdoch was supervising and ismay and mcelroy were engaged in conversation. bathroom steward isaac widgery stated ""i was asked by purser mcelroy if i understood anything about lifeboats i said “i understood a little” and just then some biscuits came up from the storekeeper. i helped him put one of the boxes into the bottom of the boat. i was then told by purser mcelroy to get into the boat. saloon steward william ward said ""purser mcelroy sent me along. they had taken the canvas off of no. 9 and lowered it, we lowered her down to level with the boat deck, and a sailor came along with a bag and threw it in the boat. this man said he had been sent down to take charge of the boat by the captain. the boatswain’s mate, haines, was there, and he ordered this man out of the boat, and the man got out again.  he stayed there for three or four minutes, and the purser took hold of my arm and said, ""get in the boat and help the boatswain’s mate pass the ladies in."" so i got in the boat, and stepped on the side, and the purser said ""are you all ready?"" haines answered “yes” and we started to pass the ladies and children into the boat. we thought we had them all in, and the purser called out, “are there any more women?”  jack thayer witnessed mcelroy at collapsible c late in the proceedings;

"NEWELL, Mr Arthur Webster",58,Male,C1,Cherbourg,0,0,113,"        mr arthur webster newell, 58, was born in chelsea, massachusetts, on january 30, 1854, the only child of benjamin and susan (bennett) newell. he was educated in chelsea's public schools. at an early age, he began to support himself. a brilliant student, eager to learn, he began working as a clerk in a boston bank. he later became a bookkeeper in the fourth national bank of boston. with the growth of business in its neighborhood, and particularly with the development of the great markets and provision houses on which the bank relied, it quickly grew in size and importance. arthur newell knew his business well. he was quick, accurate and reliable.  on october 11, 1877, arthur newell married his childhood sweetheart, mary greeley, also from chelsea, massachusetts.  in 1879, newell was appointed the bank's chief cashier. after his promotion, a daughter named madeleine was born on october 10, 1880, followed two years later by a second daughter, named alice, in 1882.  as his position in the bank advanced, mr newell's success permitted his family to move from chelsea to lexington, massachusetts, in 1888. here he bought a large home which was landscaped into an attractive gentleman's farm. mr newell became an earnest and devoted citizen of the town. aside from his business, his strongest lay in the hancock congregational church. he was ardent supporter and an upright, influential member whose convictions were deep and whose religious temperament and devotion were unmistakable.  on february 12, 1889, a third daughter was born to mr and mrs newell whom they named marjorie.  although a respected and successful businessma, mr newell attended strictly to his own business, and preferred the direct approach to any diplomacy. he had a singularly high regard for truth. flattery never left his lips and praise from him was a simple statement of fact - an act of judgment. his daughter marjorie later said that her father's inner clarity of spirit made him a keen judge of honesty and reliability in others. it was said that honest people had nothing to fear from him but the double-dealer might well avoid him.  to those who knew mr newell well, he was in outward demeanor what the world called ""cold."" his character appeared distant and austere in social circles. his companions were many, but few were close. neighbors respected him but his association with them was infrequent. as far as she could think, marjorie remembered that even her mother addressed her husband, at least in public, as ""mr newell.""  yet, mr newell was an exceedingly sensitive man who knew how highly charged words between people could be in causing pleasure and pain. to those who knew him well, he was among the most affectionate of men with a tenderness unsuspected by those who saw only the surface. despite an almost puritan character, he envinced love and warmth often.  marjorie remembered an occasion when she was a young girl of about 7 or 8. one summer, she and a neighbor boy were playing in the barn next to the newell home. the ladder leading to the loft seemed daring and together they climbed the rungs when they heard the groom approaching the barn door. the children hid among the hay bales, secretly watching from above. unknown to them, mr newell had asked one of his farm hands to kill a turkey for dinner. just as the hatchet was raised, piercing screams filled the barn. mr newell raced in where the farm hand had frozen in his tracks. the children were crying uncontrollably and quietly mr newell brought them down. before the children, he ordered that the turkey be spared (at least for the time being), and spent the entire afternoon comforting and playing with them.  another occasion occurred when madeleine, alice and marjorie were eating dinner at the dining room table. for an unknown reasons, the girls were giggling among themselves, annoying mr newell. without saying a word, he took his knife and tapped his water glass three times with a look of disapproval. this signified a quick end to the giggling. after dessert, however, mr newell perhaps concerned about his stern technique, took each daughter on one of their long walks through the countryside, often quoting from the bible and telling enchanting stories. marjorie was especially delighted. ""we were so honored to be able to go on a walk with father. he seemed so busy most of the time and we loved and respected him because of all the attention he gave us despite that. what child would feel that way about their father today?"" marjorie wondered years later.  in 1896, the newells moved to a more modern estate at 20 percy road in lexington, massachusetts. a year later, mr newell was elected chairman of the fourth national bank, now thriving in the heart of boston thanks to his oversight, wisdom and personal direction.  as the family grew, they became very close. mr newell had musical talent, and all of his daughters were taught violin by some of the best music instructors in boston. mr newell played the cello and mrs newell the piano. every sunday afternoon, the family congregated in the living room. the newell's home's choice music was a source of unfailing delight, and in history books written about lexington, the newell home was described as the site of many wonderful family musical entertainments.  as his daughters grew up, madeleine and alice went on to attend smith college in northampton, massachusetts. the elder girls were serious students while young marjorie was not. she chose to turn down the opportunity to attend smith college and freely admitted that she was not a serious student in areas that did not interest her. music and violin were her favorite recreations.  in march 1909, mr newell arranged for his family's first trip abroad to europe. none were more pleased than marjorie, who travelled with her father into boston to buy a scrapbook in which to record their journeys. the newells sailed in april aboard the white star liner romanic. they would spend more than three months visiting italy, switzerland, germany, france and england. on their return voyage home, marjorie entered the final words in her scrapbook, ""we had only our memories left of the past three months. but what were those memories - pleasant ones? yes, delightful. we have concluded that european travel is a wonderful experience and education, but like everything else in the world, everything is not perfection. but why look for unpleasantness when you leave home seeking pleasure?"" hauntingly, marjorie's next trip would end in circumstances she clearly asked herself about.  in 1912, mr newell decided to take his family overseas again. his particular area of interest was now the middle east. as a student of the bible, he very much wanted to see egypt, israel (then known as the holy land) and the surrounding areas. however, for this journey, mrs newell and daughter alice would not be joining the family. the trip to europe in 1909 had taken its toll on them. they were delicate ladies and did not feel that they had the energy or strength to make another long journey. instead, mr newell travelled with madeleine and marjorie to the lands mr newell had always wished to see.  the trio spent about three months seeing such places at cairo, bethlehem and jerusalem. marjorie remembered how impressed her father was to have seen these holy places and spoke about them constantly.  the newells left the middle east and sailed for marseilles, france in april, 1912. they eventually arrived in paris where madeleine and marjorie learned of a surprise their father had made for them. to finish such a pleasurable trip to the middle east, mr newell had made reservations for the three of them to return home to the united states aboard the maiden voyage of the rms titanic, the largest ocean liner in the world.  the newells embarked on the titanic in cherbourg, france. mr newell was assigned cabin d-48, while his daughters shared stateroom d-36. among the items they had brought with them were two violins. mr newell had reminded his girls to bring them with them so they could practice while they were touring. marjorie remembered that every evening she and her sister madeleine would play the violin in their cabins for about an hour before they went to bed.  marjorie remembered the last afternoon she would spend with her father on the titanic. she remembered sitting in deck chairs with her father and sister and talked with them about the ancient sites they had seen. she remembered looking at her father to see how pleased he was at having visited the middle east. it was as if he had finally managed to accomplish the one thing in life he had not yet done. she was very proud of him.  at dinner that last evening, marjorie remembered seeing all of the beautiful gowns being worn by the ladies as they entered the dining room for dinner. ""i had been given my first long train gown before i left home, and i took great pleasure in wearing it that night,"" marjorie said. after dinner while sitting in the titanic's reception room, mr newell pointed out mr and mrs john jacob astor to his two daughters. mr newell then turned to his daughters and asked, ""do you think you will be able to last until morning?"" he was joking with them concerning their healthy appetites. a woman who was sitting next to marjorie turned to her and said, ""don't you think the ship is going too fast? we are in the icebergs and i think we should slow down."" marjorie was unaware of the situation.  mr newell and his daughters retired at 10:30 p.m. on april 14th. about an hour and half later, marjorie remembered being awakened by the collision with the iceberg. before they could get dressed and investigate, there was a knock at their cabin door. it was mr newell. his only words were, ""get up, girls and get dressed. put on your warmest clothes and follow me.""  the sisters joined their father in the hall, and joined the other passengers heading up to the boat deck. marjorie remembered that her father was very quiet but made all possible investigations into what was going to be done. marjorie learned later that the ship had struck an iceberg and could distinctly feel the slight list the titanic was making.  when they reached the boat deck, marjorie saw one lifeboat being lowered. arthur newell turned to his daughters and told them that they would have to get into a lifeboat and row around until the damage to the titanic was repaired. he led them to lifeboat number 6 and placed them in. his last words to marjorie were, ""it does seem more dangerous for you to get into that boat than to remain here with me here but we must obey orders."" marjorie last saw her father standing back helping other women in the boat.  in her later years, marjorie thought back to that cold april night. ""i often wonder what father did after he said goodbye to us. i would like to think that he went to help other women and children. he would have never taken a place knowing there were others still aboard. i am sure he thought about my mother and sister and perhaps wished he had never taken us on this trip.""

"STEAD, Mr William Thomas",62,Male,C1,Southampton,1,0,26,"        mr william thomas stead, 62, of cambridge house, wimbledon park, london sw and 'holly bush', hayling island, hampshire was a well known journalist and author.  stead was born in manse, embleton, northumbria on 5 july 1849, he was the son of rev. w. stead a congregational minister and isabella, daughter of john jobson a yorkshire farmer.   birthplace of wt stead  in 1850 the family moved to howden-on-tyne and until the age of 12 w.t.stead was educated by his father. in 1861 stead went to silcoates school near wakefield. in 1863 when he was 14 he was apprenticed office boy in a merchants counting house on quayside in newcastle-upon-tyne.  in february 1870 he began to contribute articles to the 'northern echo', a liberal paper that had been recently founded in darlington. his work was much admired and in april 1871 he was appointed editor even though he had never been inside a newspaper office, he remained at the post until 1880, a period during which he became renowned for his strong support for gladstone in the agitation against turkey over recent bulgarian atrocities.  in 1873 he married emma lucy wilson daughter of henry wilson of howden-on-tyne and together they had six children. stead later listed his interests at cycling, boating and playing with children.  in september 1880 stead moved to london to be assistant editor of the 'pall mall gazette', a liberal publication under the editorial control of john (later viscount) morley. together they formed a successful partnership until august 1883 when morley was elected to parliament as mp for newcastle-upon-tyne. stead was thus appointed editor and over the next seven years developed what matthew arnold described as 'new journalism'. from being a relatively quiet chronicle of the day's events the gazette was transformed into an innovative and daring organ, the initiator and supporter of numerous political and social movements. an example of its influence is that of general gordon who was on the brink of retirement when, in january 1884 he was interviewed by the gazette, the publication of the interview was followed shortly after by an editorial from stead urging the government to send gordon on one last mission to khartoum. it was a mission from which gordon would never return. in 1885 the government was forced to supply an extra £3½m to bolster weakening naval defences, this was in response to stead's series of articles in the gazette entitled 'the truth about the navy.'  controversy surrounded stead in 1885 when he published the maiden tribute of modern babylon. his text exposed criminal vice and specifically child prostitution. an an almost immediate consequence of his revelations was the ressurection of the dormant criminal law amendment act which raised the age of consent to sixteen. however, stead had failed to secure evidence to protect him from prosecution and, as a result of a civil indictment, he was jailed for three months. widely vilified by the british press and public as a peddler in pornography, stead received much support from influential reformers including cardinal manning, the bishop of london (dr temple), and lord shaftsbury. read more in pages of the ""war cry"" from the salvation army.  gradually stead tired of daily journalism and in 1890 he left the gazette to found the 'review of reviews' followed in 1891 by the 'american review of reviews' and in 1892 by the 'australian review of reviews' the 'masterpiece library of penny poets, novels and prose classics' was founded in 1895.  around this time stead became interested in spiritualism and between 1893 and 1897 he edited 'borderland' a periodical devoted to the subject. although his fascination with the subject continued until he death stead's reputation diminished a decline that was to some extent compounded by his increasing pacifism at a time when the government was rallying support for the war in south africa. despite this he continued to campaign for a strong navy under the banner 'two keels to one.'  in 1898 stead had visited the tsar of russia and this visit spurred him to found and edit the 'war against war' which was a weekly paper. at this time he also preached what he termed a 'peace crusade'. after the hague conference, which he attended, he strongly opposed the war in the transvaal and wrote 'shall i slay my brother the boer' and also published the weekly organ of the stop the war committee, 'war against war in south africa'. in 1900 stead supported the formation of a union international to combat militarism and to secure the adoption of the recommendations of the hague conference. at the same time he maintained his interest in publishing and began a series of portfolios of pictorial masterpieces.  until his death stead continued to preach 'peace through arbitration' and when he boarded the titanic in southampton he was travelling to america to take part in a peace congress at carnegie hall on 21 april at the request of the president william howard taft.   w. t. stead posing for ""biofix"" photography days before boarding the titanic (click image to view animation)   stead occupied cabin c-87 (? c-89) but while the ship sank he sat quietly reading a book in the first class smoking room.  curiously, on 22 march 1886 stead had published an article entitled 'how the mail steamer went down in mid-atlantic, by a survivor'. in the story an unnamed steamer collides with another ship and due to a shortage of lifeboats there is a large loss of life. stead wrote 'this is exactly what might take place and will take place if liners are sent to sea short of boats. - ed'.  an 1892 edition of the 'review of reviews' carried the fictional story of an accident involving a white star line vessel. in the story - entitled 'from the old world to the new' - the majestic carries a clairvoyant who senses a disaster to another ship that has collided with an iceberg. the survivors are rescued and the majestic manages to avoid the ice.

""i was standing there, and i asked my brother-in-law if he could swim and he said no. i asked my cousin if he could swim and he said no. so we could see the water coming up, the bow of the ship was going down, and there was kind of an explosion. we could hear the popping and cracking, and the deck raised up and got so steep that the people could not stand on their feet on the deck. so they fell down and slid on the deck into the water right on the ship."" 		 	   when all the boats had gone olaus and his relatives found themselves near the fourth funnel, as the titanic sank deeper they clung to the falls of a lifeboat davit. his brother in law urged him to jump for it but olaus waited. when the water was only five feet away they plunged in. as he surfaced olaus became entangled in a line but somehow managed to break free, when he looked around him his brother in law and cousin were nowhere to be seen, they had been washed away.  olaus swam for twenty minutes in the icy water before finally reaching collapsible a. surrounded by dead and dying he tried to pull himself into the waterlogged boat but someone inside shouted 'don't capsize the boat', so olaus clung to the side for a while before eventually dragging himself aboard.

"ALLEN, Miss Elisabeth Walton",29,Female,C1,Southampton,0,1,211,"        elisabeth walton allen was born in st louis, missouri on 1 october 1882.  she was the daughter of george washington allen (b. 31 march 1852), a lawyer and railroad capitalist from st louis, and lydia jeanette mcmillan (b. 8 october 1853) who was born in la porte, indiana. the couple were married on 21 june 1876 in mount pleasant, pennsylvania. her father, who came from a wealthy family and who was active in local politics, was a member of the city council and one-time mayor of st louis whilst his father thomas was a builder of the iron mountain railroad and the southern hotel in st louis.  one of five children, elisabeth’s four siblings were: thomas iii (b. 8 september 1877; d. 1947), clare (b. 6 march 1881; d. 1970), george walton hocker (b. 19 november 1889; d. 1973) and whitelaw reid (b. 26 february 1891; d. 1972).  in the late 1890s the family moved from st louis to princeton, new jersey and appear on the 1900 census living at 83 mercer street, princeton; her father had no stated profession at the time. elisabeth and her sister clare were students at vassar college in poughkeepsie, new york during this timeframe (she was still listed as a student as late as 1904). it was also around this time that the family began to fall apart, her father soon beginning to live in hotels, including the southern hotel in st louis which his family had founded.   	 		 			 			 			 		 		 			george w. allen, elisabeth’s father (1892), her mother lydia (1916) and brother thomas (1920) 		 	   elisabeth’s mother was, by reports, burdened with alcoholism and in an attempt to cure her her husband had sent her, by her own request, to paris in the hope that the change of surroundings might help her to “overcome her weakness.” with that trip not having the desired effect, she was dispatched to canada for the same purpose but again to no avail. his eleventh-hour attempt was to send her to an institute in boston in early january 1901, again without the desired result. before leaving for st louis on business he instructed his son thomas, a new york-based lawyer, to remove his younger brothers from the family home.    elisabeth’s younger brothers george (1920) and whitelaw (1918)  mrs allen, who later stated that she was in boston on “a matter of business” but falling ill and bedridden for a stretch, wrote and telegraphed her home asking for her two youngest sons to be brought to her. these requests went unanswered and when mrs allen was sufficiently well to travel she returned to princeton to find that both her youngest sons were nowhere to be found and could not determine their whereabouts for several days. they had been taken by their elder brother thomas to new york where they stayed at a boarding house at 46 east 21st street. on learning of their location mrs allen immediately hastened to fetch them but thomas allen refused to surrender the two boys. she immediately launched legal proceedings, alleging her sons had been kidnapped and “restrained of their liberty” by their elder brother.  it soon emerged that lydia’s husband george washington allen, who was still in st louis on business, had declared that he had ordered his son thomas to remove the two boys from the family home because his wife lydia, whom he accused of habitual drunkenness, “was not the proper person to have charge of them” and threatened to fight the proceedings in the courts. mr allen went on to say:   “they were not abducted. i told my elder son to secure possession of the children and to keep them away from their mother. he did so. i don’t know where he took them. i expect to do all i can to prevent their mother from securing them again, as she is not the proper kind of a person to have charge of them.” - the st louis republic, 21 january 1901   at the ensuing trial, the two young boys who had been separated from their mother ran to her and they caressed in an emotional scene. both boys were soon reigned into their brother’s control in the courtroom.  the outcome of the legal process was not favourable for mrs allen, who attempted to defend her alcoholism on the grounds of medical requirements. further to this, george washington allen filed for divorce on 1 january 1902, citing his wife’s 15-year-long drinking habit and the “intolerable humiliation and indignities” he suffered as a result. the hearing was brief and the st louis republic reported on 16 january 1902 that mr allen was granted a divorce and awarded the custody of his two minor sons.  with a divorce finalised george washington allen promptly remarried in march 1903 to a miss eliza doherty of atlanta.  elisabeth’s mother never remarried and divided her time between st louis and cazenovia, new york. the 1910 census shows mrs allen with her sons george and whitelaw as residents of the green in cazenovia but elisabeth was not listed at the address. instead, for the previous few years she had been spending considerable portions of her time in europe, particularly britain, and in january 1911 travelled with her maternal aunt mrs elisabeth mcmillan robert and her daughter, miss allen’s cousin georgette madill, the heiress of a large fortune. during this time she became engaged to physician james beaver mennell. her sister clare was engaged around the same time to harvard history professor charles homer haskins.  james beaver mennell was born in shepherds bush, london, england on 31 january 1880 to surgeon zebulon mennell and the former jane lilias hudson gillies. by 1911 he was a boarder at 107 palace road in lambeth, london and was described as the resident medical officer of st thomas’ house.  elisabeth was set to return to her home in st. louis with her aunt and miss madill. intending to gather her belongings and settle her affairs in the us for preparation for her imminent marriage, miss allen, her aunt, cousin and her aunt’s maid emilie kreuchen all boarded the titanic in southampton as first-class passengers. for the voyage, miss allen shared cabin b-5 with cousin georgette, whilst mrs robert was across the hall in cabin b3 . the entire party travelled under ticket number 24160 (which cost £221, 16s, 9d).   elisabeth allen  (the paterson press, 20 april 1912)  miss allen escaped the sinking with her relatives in lifeboat 2, one of the last boats to leave the titanic, under the command of fourth officer joseph boxhall.   regarding the disaster, miss allen wrote:   mrs. j. b. mennell (née allen):  my aunt, mrs. roberts' maid, came to the door and asked if she could speak to me. i went into the corridor and she said: "" miss allen, the baggage room is full of water."" i replied she needn't worry, that the water-tight compartments would be shut and it would be all right for her to go back to her cabin. she went back and returned to us immediately to say her cabin, which was forward on deck e, was flooded.  we were on the boat deck some minutes before being ordered into the lifeboat. neither my aunt, mrs. roberts, my cousin, miss madill, nor myself ever saw or heard the band. as we stood there we saw a line of men file by and get into the boat-some sixteen or eighteen stokers. an officer i came along and shouted to them: ""get out, you damned cowards; i'd like to see everyone of you overboard."" they all got out and the officer said: ""women and children into this boat,"" and we got in and were lowered.  with the exception of two very harrowing leave-takings, we saw nothing but perfect order and quiet on board the titanic. we were rowed round the stern to the starboard side and away from the ship, as our boat was a small one and boxhall feared the suction. mrs. cornell helped to row all the time.

"BADMAN, Miss Emily Louisa",18,Female,C3,Southampton,0,1,8,"        miss emily louisa badman was born in clevedon, somerset, england on 19 january 1894.   she was the daughter of solomon badman (1853-1918), a labourer, and emily cox (1861-1929), somerset natives of banwell and worle, respectively, who had married on 31 december 1878 in banwell parish church.   one of seven surviving children from a total of eleven, emily's known siblings were: mary jane (1879-1962), george (1881-1890), henry john (1883-1949), caroline1 (1886-1973), solomon charles (b. 1888), arthur (1891-1955), william james (1896-1898), ada irene2 (1899-1934) and ellen maud3 (1903-1978).  emily first appears on the 1901 census when she and her family were living at briarside, kenn, somerset. the family were listed on the 1911 census as living at 128 kenn road, clevedon but emily was absent and listed elsewhere as a domestic housemaid at holmwood, walton park, clevedon, the family home of a mr george whitfield mott-distin, a wealthy retired provision merchant, and his family.  at least two of emily's siblings had made the leap and moved to america and, hoping for a better life for herself, emily had full intentions of joining them. her sister mary jane (mrs ernest arthur) had emigrated in march 1910 along with her husband and young son cecil ernest (b. 1908), settling in skaneateles, new york and saving enough money to send emily the fare with which to join her. emily's mother was against any notion of her travelling alone across the atlantic but soon relented. it was also planned that emily was to be met in manhattan by her cousin mrs may gillis (née cox, daughter of george cox). as both cousins had never met, they had arranged to wear a bow of orange (or yellow, depending on the article) ribbon tied to each of their left wrists in order to ease identification.  after being accompanied to the white star line terminal by a brother, miss badman boarded the titanic at southampton as a third-class passenger (ticket number a/4 31416 which cost  £8 1s) and she and three other women shared a cabin located somewhere in the bow.  whilst aboard she made the acquaintance of several other english passengers, including sarah roth, and the goldsmith family, and possibly also gained an admirer, edward lockyer. in interviews many years later emily recalled some particulars about him, including the fact that he was from sandhurst, a minute detail possibly indicating that the pair got to know each other quite well aboard the ship.   sometime around the evening of 14 april 1912 emily and edward lockyer had enjoyed a stroll together on the open deck; fearing the breeze would pull her spectacles off of her face, emily removed them and gave them to lockyer for safekeeping, along with a small mesh purse containing some coins. he placed the items in his pocket and the pair went on with their stroll. later over dinner, she told her companion that she would love the opportunity to see such a grand ship such as titanic from a smaller boat. that evening she went to bed at around 10.30 pm.   in an interview printed in the auburn citizen (24 april 1912), emily recalled being awoken by a sound ""as if the boat were scraping land""; she dressed and left her cabin to investigate and found the passageways ""filled with foreigners going up on deck loaded with luggage,"" many wearing cumbersome lifebelts. in another interview with the skaneateles free press (23 april 1912), miss badman recalled hearing stewards imploring some other women passengers to get dressed and head up top but that they were unmoved and scoffed at such suggestions.   emily badman the democrat, 25 april 1912  miss badman went to one of the upper decks where she encountered edward lockyer who told her to go back to her cabin for heavier clothing. she did not want to do so and instead, he helped her into a lifebelt. she found this piece of lifesaving apparatus so mortifying that she put her coat on over the top of it so that others could not see her wearing it.    the same interview, perhaps embellished either by herself or the reporter, stated that miss badman and lockyer waited on deck (perhaps the aft well-deck) for some time before a call for ""... all women and children this way"" came. again she was reluctant to go but lockyer took her and guided her up to the lifeboats. on deck, she described seeing two men shot, one a steward who refused to cooperate with an officer, and the other an italian who had jumped into a lowering lifeboat. she described being one of the last-placed in her lifeboat before it was lowered and later recalled catching a final glance at the young man who had been so considerate of her safety, edward lockyer.  it was only after the lifeboat was launched that emily realised how deep titanic had sunk. she then recalled the conversation she had had with lockyer earlier about how she wanted to see titanic from a smaller boat; she did not realise that wish would come true, nor in such circumstances.   after her lifeboat rowed out about a mile miss badman recalled hearing two explosions coming from the ship which then broke in two:  ""... the front end went down at once and the back stood up so that it was almost straight and then went out of sight."" - the auburn citizen, 24 april 1912  with the ship foundered emily recalled the screams of those left behind; naively she thought that, with most wearing life preservers, they would later be picked up safely. she herself suffered from exposure and found the conditions in the lifeboat to be cramped.  in which lifeboat miss badman escaped is unclear; in a 1912 interview (skaneateles free press, 23 april 1912) she stated she escaped in the last lifeboat but one and as such several historians place her in collapsible c. however, in a 1932 interview with the record it was stated that she was in lifeboat 13, she described the skipper of the boat, a stoker, telling the occupants of the boat to sing to drown out the cries of those struggling in the water. lifeboat 13 was the second to last lifeboat in its section of the boat deck to leave so she may well have been in this boat.  miss badman recalled that she tried to help reassure some women who had parted from their husbands that they might end up in new york before them. as her lifeboat approached at around 7.00 am emily, still trying to buoy the hopes of the other survivors, joked that their lifeboat was oxford and that another nearby was cambridge and it became a competition to see who would win the race to the rescue ship.  the enormity of the tragedy only dawned on emily when she was aboard carpathia; it was there she noticed how few men had survived and also realised that she was the only one from a total of twenty people from her dining table aboard titanic. she also noted how many other women whose faces she had become familiar with over the journey were nowhere to be seen. in a 1938 interview, emily recalled sharing a compartment aboard carpathia with another woman whose hair turned white overnight.    arriving in new york emily was described as an unmarried domestic aged 18 and gave her destination as to the home of her sister, mrs ernest arthur, in skaneateles. before going there she spent time recuperating in st vincent's hospital due to the effects of shock and exposure. despite all the hardships she had endured she never allowed her bow of orange ribbon to be taken from her and when her cousin mrs gillis arrived in manhattan to search for her, scouring hospitals for survivors, she was also wearing her own ribbon as planned. the recognition between the two women was instantaneous. before leaving manhattan emily acted as bridesmaid to fellow survivor sarah roth who married daniel iles in st vincent's hospital on 23 april.  ",Servant,3rd Class Passenger,,C,English,https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/emily-badman.html

'we've struck an iceberg,' the captain said, 'and i'm having an inspection made to tell what it has done for us. you better get ready to send out a call for assistance. but don't send it until i tell you.' the captain went away and in ten minutes, i should estimate the time, he came back. we could hear a terrible confusion outside, but there was not the least thing to indicate that there was any trouble. the wireless was working perfectly. 'send the call for assistance,' said the captain, barely putting his head in the door. 'what call should i send?' phillips asked. 'the regulation international call for help. just that.' then the captain was gone. phillips began to send cqd he flashed away at it and we were joking while he did so. all of us made light of the disaster. we joked that way while he flashed signals for about five minutes. then the captain came back. 'what are you sending?' he asked. 'cqd' phillips replied. the humour of the situation appealed to me. i cut in with a little remark that made us all laugh, including the captain. 'send sos,' i said. 'it's the new call, and it may be your last chance to send it.' phillips with a laugh changed the signal to sos.""   both operators stayed at their post after their release, but were forced out onto the deck by the water surging into the wireless room:   ""i noticed as i came back from one trip that they were putting off women and children in lifeboats. i noticed that the list forward was increasing. phillips told me the wireless was growing weaker. the captain came and told us our engine rooms were taking water and that the dynamos might not last much longer. we sent that word to the carpathia.",Assistant Telegraphist,Victualling Crew,,B,English,https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/harold-sydney-bride.html

"BROWN, Mr Edward",34,Male,Crew,Belfast,0,1,0,"          mr edward brown was born in holyhead, anglesey, wales on 20 march 1878.  he was the son of hugh jones brown (1833-1887) and margaret williams (1845-1898), both holyhead-natives who had married in bangor in 1869.   edward had at least three siblings: thomas (b. 1871), ann (b. 1874) and hugh (b. 1882).  he first appears on the 1881 census living at 26 cross street, holyhead with his mother and siblings but his mariner father was not present. the family were still at the same address for the 1891 and 1901 census returns but by the latter both edward's parents were deceased. he was described as a barman in the 1901 census and went to sea around 1904, first serving for the dominion line.   he initially signed-on to the titanic in belfast for her delivery trip to southampton. when he signed-on for the second time in southampton on 4 april 1912, he gave his address as 43 suffolk avenue, southampton, the home address of fellow crewmembers, brothers arthur and benjamin mcmicken. brown had served as a steward on board several white star ships before the titanic, among them the cedric, teutonic, oceanic, adriatic, and, most recently, the olympic. as a first-class steward he received £3 15s per month.  during the course of the voyage, brown had checked to see his assigned lifeboat in the pantry, noting it was boat 5.   on the night of sunday 14 april brown was off duty and asleep but was awakened by the collision but he initially believed that there was no danger. after about 20 minutes orders filtered down that the stewards were to assemble at the boat deck.   brown prepared and went to his assigned boat which he helped to load but saw off without getting into it, offering to reason at the inquiry as to why not. he presumably helped fill and see off other boats and later assisted at collapsible c late in the proceedings, helping see the boat hooked into lifeboat 1's vacant davits and slung over the side.   as boat c was being loaded brown recalled ismay calling out for women and children first. he stated ismay got into the collapsible and assisted women and children enter before the boat was lowered away. brown's evidence offers up a different and less dramatic version of ismay's escape; according to him ismay was in the lifeboat for some time, helping others cross into the boat and did not, as many outlets would otherwise state, step into the boat as it was lowered.  after boat c was lowered brown stated that he and others turned their attention to working on collapsible a which was housed atop the officer's quarters, the men using two planks they'd procured from somewhere near the bow and sliding the boat down to the boat deck. their attempts to hook that boat up to the davits proved more troublesome, however, as a growing list to starboard prevented them from being able to get it to the davits. only with the falls slackened off did they manage to get the boat secured but the growing list made sure that the men working there were unable to sling the boat outboard as would be normal.   brown reported that the captain passed by around this time, megaphone in hand, saying to them ""well, boys, do your best for the women and children, and look out for yourselves."" before walking towards the bridge. he also observed a group of four or five women stood nearby waiting to board the collapsible but during the struggle to get the boat ready to launch the ship plunged and the bridge and forward boat deck was inundated.   brown, presumably situated at the after fall, found himself knee-deep in seawater and managed to pull himself into the collapsible boat where he then cut through the aft-fall before calling out to someone situated forward to do the same but he could not say if anyone complied as he was washed out of the boat at that point and he saw the handful of women who had been waiting nearby struggling in the water nearby himself.  whilst in the water brown reported being caught in a whirlpool of water due to the suction and was dragged down a bit before coming up again. he heard a large rumbling or explosion after resurfacing and saw a lot of people in the water nearby, the lights of the ship still burning, and related that he believed the bow separated from stern at this point.  situated near the forward funnel of the ship brown saw a black object ahead of him and did his best to make towards it. brown, who was unable to swim, later credited his lifebelt for his salvation and he was able to pull himself toward collapsible a which was half-submerged and which he estimated had 16 or 17 persons aboard it. during the night they pulled a woman (rhoda abbott) and ""a very big gentleman"" from the ocean. he recalled three stewards and one fireman aboard, the rest being passengers and he recalled barber august weikman and steward william watson lucas being among the crowd. the occupants were later rescued by boat 14 sometime after daylight.   safely in boat 14 brown found his hands and feet had swollen, the latter bloated enough to have burst his boots. despite that he volunteered to take an oar and situated himself on the portside.   although not required to give evidence at the american inquiry, upon return to britain edward was called to give evidence to the british inquiry on day 9. edward continued to work at sea; by 1920 he was a saloon steward aboard cretic and immigration records at the time describe him as standing at 5' 8½"" and weighing 140 lbs. in 1924 he was working as a bedroom steward aboard laconia.  he was married in 1919 to bertha holden (b. 10 may 1890 in liverpool) and the couple had a daughter the following year, elizabeth margaret (b. 26 january 1920).     edward brown c.1920  his family believe that the titanic disaster had an adverse effect on edward's health and this contributed to his early death in liverpool on 3 june 1926.  he is buried in kirkdale cemetery, liverpool, england (section c/e 17, plot 3293 in an unmarked public grave.

with it being a small cabin, buckley left to give them room to dress themselves whilst he waited outside. two crewmen passed by shouting ""all up on deck unless you want to get drowned!"" and buckley immediately hastened to the upper decks and never saw his friends again.   arriving in communal areas buckley noticed other passengers wearing lifejackets but he had none so made his way back down to his cabin to retrieve it; he was stopped in his tracks as the water in the area was coming level with the third or fourth step of the staircase.   at one point buckley was gathered with some other steerage men when one attempted to ascend a small flight of stairs into a first class area of the ship; a crewman came along and pushed the man back and snapped the gate shut and locked it. the same steerage passenger angrily chased after the man and broke the lock on the gate; he could not find the offending crewman and said if he had he would have chucked him into the ocean.  buckley began to look elsewhere for a lifejacket and soon encountered a first class passenger who had two; the man surrendered one to him and helped him to fasten it on. he made his way to the boat deck where he stated that he assisted in helping lower five lifeboats. he was standing at boat 13 when a crowd of male passengers and crew jumped into the boat; buckley made a split-second decision to join them and leapt in himself. two officers came along with a crowd of steerage passengers and ordered the men out, most complied, leaving only he and five other men, firemen and sailors—he broke down and began to cry at the thought of his fate but a compassionate woman in the boat threw her shawl over his head and told him to hold fast. he mistakenly believed the woman to be mrs astor. the disguise worked and the boat was lowered to the water. his friend bridget bradley was in the same boat and buckley recalled her being very nervous and excitable, attempting to climb one of the falls when she thought the lifeboat was sinking, only to be subdued by a crewman.  as the night wore on those in the lifeboat spied the lights of carpathia; such a welcome sight caused many to become hysterical and jump around; the crew attempted to control them and have them sit back down but many remained standing.   daniel was later called upon to testify at the american inquiry into the sinking, one of the few third-class passengers to do so.  it is not certain if daniel ever returned to ireland and he was later joined in america by his sister catherine. he lived at 284 east 137th street in bronx, new york.    the europe buckley left behind erupted into war and when the usa became involved he voluntarily enlisted into the 69th new york infantry (later the 165th regiment) as a private on 1 june 1917. he served in france from the end of october 1917 and was promoted to 1st class private on 1 september 1918. of the various campaigns he was involved with, one of the most noteworthy was the rouge bouquet campaign; on 7 march 1918 german artillery bombarded american trenches and the 165th regiment suffered heavy losses; daniel was one of the few survivors from that regiment. only a few weeks later, on 21 march 1918 he was ""slightly wounded"".

"" never shall i forget the feeling of all on board our boat when the carpathia hove in sight. we who were at the oars pulled with renewed spirits, and one by one the boats took up the hymn ""pull for the shore, sailor,"" as we put our backs to the work. the officers and crew of the carpathia were kind and attentive beyond all praise, as were the american people on our arrival in new york. they fitted us all out with a double suit of everything. on our homeward journey by the lapland we were treated most kindly...""   upon charles' return home to swanage he was received by a large crowd of well-wishers and the bells of the local church peeled.  charles continued working at sea into the 1940s, later serving on ships operating between southampton and south africa. he married a rhodesian-born woman, henrietta jane (b. 19 november 1890), and they had a son, grenville thomas charles and settled in rhodesia (modern-day zimbabwe). by 1939 he was working as baker aboard arundel castle, operating between durban and southampton; he later left the sea and worked as a stationmaster in rhodesia and on 13 april 1956 he and his wife arrived in southampton as tourist class passengers aboard winchester castle. ",Extra 3rd.

"BURKE, Mr William",39,Male,Crew,Belfast,0,1,0,"        mr william burke was born at clifton terrace in glenbrook near queenstown (modern-day cobh) in co cork, ireland on 5 november 1872.1 he was baptised on 14 november the same year.     william’s birth registration  he was the son of james burke (b. circa 1837), a shipwright, and catherine calway (b. circa 1843) who had married in 1866.   he had eight known siblings, including two sets of twins: catherine (b. 27 june 1867), ellen (b. circa 1868), catherine mary (b. 4 april 1875), twins hanna and lizzie (b. 29 september 1877), twins rebecca and james (b. 8 october 1880) and agnes (b. 6 january 1884).   the family apparently moved to britain sometime after 1884 and they appear on the 1891 census living at 216 arlington street, kirkdale, lancashire, with a young william being described as a grocer's assistant.   the family later appear on the 1901 census as residents of virginia street, bootle, the home address of his sister mrs edward (ellen) campbell and her family; william, then aged 28, was still a grocer's assistant.   by 1902 william burke had already begun service at sea and was shown serving as a steward aboard the haverford of the american line before making several trips aboard cymric of the white star line; at that stage, his liverpool address was 8 grove street. during 1903 he was living at 23 belmont drive and was serving aboard suevic before joining the majestic on which he would serve for several years. by 1907 he was a resident of 7 aubrey street, liverpool.  when burke signed-on to the titanic on 4 april 1912 he gave his address as 57 bridge road, southampton2.  his previous ship had been the olympic and as a first-class dining room steward he received monthly wages of £3, 15s.  during the voyage burkes assigned passengers were isidor and ida straus; he recalled that they came to dine at 7.15 pm on sunday 14 april but never saw them after that.  at the time of the collision, burke was in his quarters in his bunk but not asleep. the sensation of the impact brought him to the conclusion that the ship had dropped as propeller blade and he remained unstirred from his bunk for around 15 minutes before getting up. another 15 minutes or so passed before an order filtered down to get dressed and to bring overcoats and lifebelts and head up top. burke did as commanded but nearly left without a lifebelt, a colleague reminding him to fetch one. burke made his way topside and positioned himself at the starboard boat deck and went o his assigned boat, boat 1, but found that it had already left.  burke busied himself assisting in the loading of other lifeboats on the starboard side before crossing to the port side and assisting in loading and lowering boat 8 before heading aft to boat 10. chief officer wilde was conducting matters around boat 10 and his query as to how many seamen were in the boat was answered by ""two, sir."" wilde called out if there were any men who could handle an oar and a man, who burke took to be a foreigner, approached the chief; he could not hear their conversation but wilde brushed the man aside, saying ""you are of no use to me."" burke approached the officer and told him that he could handle an oar and he was immediately told to board the lifeboat. another unidentified officer arrived on the scene at this time.  burke assisted women and children into the boat; one of the last to attempt to board fell between the side of the lifeboat and the deck; burke miraculously caught her ankle and attempted to haul her into the boat but a man on a-deck had other ideas and attempted to pull her onto the deck--burke eventually relinquished the woman to the other man.  after the boat was lowered burke took an oar with a seaman and fireman charles rice and he helped row the boat about a quarter of a mile out from the ship. during the night boat 10 was tied to other boats to form a flotilla and received more passengers from other boats.   during the night some women drew his attention to the fact that there were two men hiding in the bottom of the boat; he approached and extricated both men from their hiding places; one was japanese (masabumi hosono) and the other, a large man, burke identified as italian but all the man could say was ""armenian."" he put the two men to the oars.   upon arrival in new york burke was called as a witness to the us inquiry, giving evidence on day 9 (27 april 1912).   william burke (centre) with fellow surviving stewards f. dent ray (left) and andrew cunningham (right) (library of congress)  burke resumed his career at sea; by 1930, at age 57, he was a steward aboard the ss leviathan and, for reasons unknown, held us seaman papers. he was described as standing at 5’ 10” and had black hair, brown eyes and a fair complexion.     william burke in 1930, alongside his left thumbprint   william’s signature in 1930   william had married in liverpool on 23 june 1917 to mary elizabeth osborne (b. 1894) and they had three children: william francis (1918-1918), lilian winifred (b. 1921, later mrs ronald jones) and harold edmund (b. 1922). their firstborn, william, lived just five days and was later buried in ford cemetery, liverpool.  during the 1950s william spoke of his experiences whilst titanic-mania was at its height following the publication of a night to remember and the following book-turned-movie.

(1827-1917), and louisa ellen anderson (1844-1933) who were married in montgomery, tennessee on 22 june 1869. one of her paternal ancestors was the eleventh us president, james knox polk (1795-1849).  lucile had two brothers, anderson (b. 17 march 1870; d. 1949) and david peale (b. 9 may 1880; d. 1959).  her washington, dc-born father had come to baltimore with his family as an adolescent and began his career as a clerk with a shipping company until entering naval service in 1853 as a paymaster before receiving an appointment to the virginia military institute. with the outbreak of the civil war he was commissioned a captain of engineers for the confederate army and served in that capacity for the duration, later returning to baltimore where he became involved in the insurance business, entering the underwriting field in 1866 as a member of the firm of john s. selby & co., later becoming sole partner of the agency. he later married lou ellen anderson, a native of kentucky2, in 1869.  coming from wealth and pedigree, lucile was universally described as one of the most beautiful young women in baltimore social circles; her engagement to philadelphia-born mining heir william ernest carter was announced in october 1895:  the engagement of miss lucile polk, of baltimore, to mr. william e. carter, of philadelphia, has just been announced. miss polk is the only daughter of mr and mrs william stewart polk, and for two seasons in baltimore and at narragansett has been a great belle and noted beauty. she is a first cousin of the beautiful mrs. stilson hutchins of washington, who chaperoned her at narragansett this summer. mr carter is a son of the late william t. carter, of philadelphia, and met miss polk at narragansett, where his coach and four were daily at her disposal. the wedding will take place in january, and will be an event of much fashionable importance in baltimore.  - new york herald, 25 october 1895  both were married at franklin street presbyterian church in baltimore on 29 january 1896:  ... the bride wore a handsome princess gown of heavy white satin with train, a marie antoinette point lace collar and tulle veil, and carried a bouquet of white orchids. there were no bridesmaids, and miss alice carter, sister of the groom, was the maid of honor. edgar trotter price, of philadelphia, acted as best man... a wedding breakfast followed at the mount vernon hotel, after which mr and mrs carter started for florida for a short trip, when they will return to philadelphia. in the spring they will sail for europe.  - philadelphia times, 30 january 1896  the couple had two children: lucile polk (1898-1962) and william thornton (1900-1985).  at the beginning of their marriage the young couple settled at 1910 rittenhouse square, philadelphia, but later their country residence, “gwedna"" in bryn mawr became their main home and the location of numerous magnificent receptions and dinners. quickly william and lucile carter became part of the fashionable and cosmopolitan circles in newport, baltimore, new york, washington and philadelphia, which included the astors, vanderbilts, wideners, goelets and drexels. the carters usually spent the summer in newport, rhode island, where in 1901 they purchased their cottage “quatrefoil” in narragansett avenue.  the family travelled extensively in europe, especially in england where they remained for protracted periods. passenger lists furnish proof of their voyages in 1902, 1904-1906, 1907, 1908-1910. on 20 february 1906, at the first royal levee of the season, whitelaw reid, united states ambassador to the united kingdom, presented william ernest carter to king edward vii.  mrs carter often appeared in gossip pages, noted her athletic prowess (she was reportedly the first woman to play polo riding astride) and her beauty:  in newport mrs carter was declared to be the most perfect type of blonde in american society. withal, she was as vivacious as the most sparkling-eyed brunette. she was rival of her husband in the matter of smartly driving a four-in-hand. - times dispatch on 16 may 1911  her glamorous and often audacious fashions were also frequently noted, one example coming from the times dispatch on 16 may 1911:  society woman in green tights  mrs “willie” carter startles fashionable hotel crowds by daring costume  philadelphia, may 15—the harem is a shrinking violet of a costume compared to that worn by mrs willie carter, the famous golden-haired philadelphia beauty, on an evening recently in the corridors of the bellevue-stratford hotel in this city. the wealthy young matron, who is well-known in new york, newport and london society, herself appeared nonchalant and unconscious of the surprise, sensation, to say nothing of consternation, that she was causing in her stroll around the thickly carpeted lane of the hotel, and she seemed equally unaware that word had passed outside, so that men and youths pressed in from the street to have a look for themselves at the “lady wearing tights.”  tights, obviously, mrs carter was wearing. they were of glossy silk, and they were green—a vivid if tempered green. she was accompanied by a woman friend during her rambles in the hotel corridors. when she alighted from her motor car and entered the big, brilliantly lighted lobby nothing unusual was noticed regarding her costume.  her cloak flung back  she wore a chic parisian hat and a long opera coat, but as she strolled about the cloak became a trifle oppressive and she flung it open and back upon her shoulders and continued strolling. her sang-froid was decidedly piquant, considering that in throwing open her opera coat the full length of the green silk tights was displayed…  in may 1911 the carter family sailed aboard the lusitania for england once again. they participated in the coronation celebration of their majesties king george v and queen mary and the london season. in winter william carter rented rotherby manor in melton-mowbray district, leicestershire to attend the hunting season.  in march 1912 the family decided to return to america and made reservations on the olympic, departing from southampton on 3 april. at the last minute, they changed their plans and booked cabins on titanic.  mrs carter boarded the titanic at southampton as a first-class passenger together with her husband and their children lucile and william. they held ticket number 113760 (which cost £120) and occupied cabins b-96 and 98. also travelling were mrs carter's maid augusta serreplaà, mr carter's manservant alexander cairns and, travelling in second class, carter's chauffeur augustus aldworth. two family pets were also making the crossing, an airedale terrier and mrs carter's pekinese spaniel, probably named me too.   ",,1st Class Passenger,B96/98,4,American,https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/lucile-carter.html

"COHEN, Mr Gurshon",19,Male,C3,Southampton,0,1,8,"          gershon cohen, known as gus, was born in whitechapel, london, england on 31 december 1892.1  hailing from a jewish family, he was the son of israel (b. 1868) and rachel cohen (b. 1869) both tailors who hailed from the russian empire(2) and who had married around 1890.  gus was one of seven of their children and one of only four who lived past early infancy, his surviving siblings being: marks (b. 1891), abraham (b. 1895) and hyman (b. 1901).   gus and his family first appear on the 1901 census when living at 166 montague street, mile end, london. by the time of the 1911 census the family home was 7 brady street, whitechapel; gus was described as a compositor and his brothers marks and hyman as sign-writers and shop-fitters.   with his printing business not performing well, gus decided to join his uncle at 101 cook street in brooklyn, new york with the intention of opening his own haberdashery business and earning enough money to bring his sweetheart hettie across so that they could eventually be married. he borrowed money from a relative for the fare.  apparently booked aboard another vessel, the teutonic, his orthodox father forbade him from travelling over a jewish holiday and therefore his travel plans were switched to the titanic. another version is that he was supposed to travel on adriatic but it was the coal strike that forced him to switch ships.  he boarded the titanic at southampton on 10 april 1912, travelling third class (ticket number 3540 which cost £8, 1s). aboard he shared a cabin with five other british men and recalled that there were a large number of jews berthed in his section of the ship.  on sunday 14 april cohen had retired to his berth at around 10.30 pm and was asleep at the time of the collision; it was enough to wake him but he thought that something had maybe gone amiss in the engine rooms. nevertheless he decided to investigate and put on a coat and headed to the forward well-deck where he saw chunks of ice lying on the deck. he returned to his berth but in the short time he had been away the floor of his cabin was beginning to flood with sea water.   the master-at-arms ordered him and his friends to get their lifejackets but they received no further orders. with no sense of any danger cohen's mind was soon changed when a passing crewman from the engine room said to him that he better get up top as there was heavy flooding below.   heading aft along scotland road gus peered into the third class dining room and stated that he saw a large group of irish girls gathered there, all with their rosaries and in prayer.   managing to navigate the different decks gus managed to get to the lifeboats but was prevented from entering one by a crewman. the manner of his survival is questionable; one version has him sliding down a fall or jumping into the ocean, being hauled aboard a passing boat. it may be the case that he managed to pass into lifeboat 12 undetected and was saved that way.  although he recalled seeing the ship's orchestra, gus was adamant that they were not playing their instruments during the ship's final throes. a sound that never left him was that of those people left behind who were struggling for their lives.  aboard the carpathia gus wrote a letter to his parents to inform them of his safety.   the titanic was only gus' first brush with death and his encounters with calamity earned him the nickname ""the cat"" because his friends said he had used up most of his nine lives. he served his country during wwi and escaped with his life but was blinded in one eye after being shot twice in the same day. several years later he stepped out from the wrong side of a train and fell onto the tracks; luckily that time he escaped with just severe bruising. his next near-miss came when he was knocked down in a hit-and-run accident and sustained a fractured skull. in the late 1930s, a bout of rheumatic fever nearly ended him but he later recovered and returned to work. during wwii he survived the blitz when a building that he oversaw was destroyed.  gus was married in london in 1917 to his longstanding fiancée and namesake, hettie cohen (b. 23 may 1893); they remained childless and during the 1930s were residents of 106 evelyn court in hackney, london where gus worked as an assistant buyer. the couple later retired to southend-on-sea, essex where they spent the rest of their lives. undaunted by his experiences, gus and his wife enjoyed going on cruises up until hettie suffered a debilitating stroke in the late 1960s.  during the 1950s gus regularly corresponded with walter lord when the latter was writing a night to remember. in 1958, when that book became a movie and interest in the topic soared, cohen was reunited with many of his fellow survivors. he would later give several television and countless newspaper interviews about his brush with death in 1912.    gus cohen in 1975 ",Printer / Compositor,3rd Class Passenger,,12,English,https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/gurshon-gus-cohen.html

"CRIBB, Miss Laura May",16,Female,C3,Southampton,0,1,16,"        miss laura may cribb was born in newark, essex, new jersey on 24 july 1895.  she was the daughter of an anglo-australian father, john hatfield cribb (b. 27 april 1868), a butler, and an english-born mother, bessie jane welch (b. 8 february 1868). her father was born in adelaide to english parents and later returned to england where he was married in 1894 to bessie jane welch who was a native of parkstone, dorset. the couple settled in newark, new jersey where they began their family.  she had three siblings: ernest hatfield (b. 23 may 1897), ellen kate (b. 17 december 1899) and frank victor (b. 20 december 1905), all of who were born in england.    laura was a sickly child and as an infant her parents were advised that the new jersey climate and its polluted air were not favourable to her health; mrs cribb was advised to bring her baby daughter back to rural england whilst her father remained in newark, he eventually traversing the ocean frequently to see to his family.    laura and her family appear on the 1901 census living at ashley road, branksome, dorset and later on the 1911 census at helenita, salterns road, poole. at the time of the later record she was described as an apprentice in the ""view department"" (?). her father made another visit to britain in september 1911 and during this latest trip laura decided she wanted to return to her birthplace.   laura and her father boarded the titanic at southampton on 10 april 1912 as third-class passengers (ticket number 371362, which cost £16, 2s). their destination was newark, new jersey and it was intended that the rest of the family would join them in due course to settle permanently.  miss cribb later spoke of her experiences to the newark evening star (19 april 1912):  we were up later than usual that night, for the weather was fine and the stars were bright. most of the third cabin, where father and i were, had stayed up late and were just turning in for the night. i had said goodbye to papa and was in my room, but had not disrobed, and that is how i happen to be wearing the same black dress which i wore all day sunday on the titanic.  i felt the jolt when the iceberg was struck, but was not much frightened, until the men and women commenced to shout and scream and rush for the deck. the i looked around for father. i am sure he was looking for me, too, because several times i thought i heard his voice calling my name. it sounded faintly above the tumult, and even after i had been almost pushed into a lifeboat and it had been cut away from the ship, i still imagined i heard papa calling and i tried to answer, but my voice was as nothing against the awful noise.  it did not seem long after we were taken off until the big vessel went down. it was terrible to realise that there were people drowning. of course, i could not help, but hope and almost feel sure that my father was safe aboard another boat. it did not seem possible that anything so serious could happen. i was almost frozen before we were finally taken aboard the carpathia, for i had only this dress, and none of the others had any more clothing.  this account differs in several respects from accounts she gave later, and only the following day in an interview with a different paper, the newark star, she gave an alternate account which included meeting up with her father who escorted her to a lifeboat. in a 1948 interview, which sticks closely to her second interview, laura stated that she had been asleep at the time of the collision, the jolt making her sit upright in bed where she sat for several minutes, listening to her bunkmates’ breathing. one of her cabinmates then awoke, exclaiming “oh, my god, what has happened?” before imploring laura to go an investigate as she could not leave her children alone. laura complied and left their cabin, finding the passageways full of people with the same curiosity. she then said:  i had only been in the main passage a few minutes when i heard father calling me, and i answered as loudly as i could and soon he was beside me, and he asked me if i was fully dressed, and i replied that i was, so we went up to the end of the passage to talk with some of our fellow passengers. after we had been laughing and chatting for a while, my father turned to me and said that we should probably have to go out in the lifeboats for half an hour or more as we had met with an accident and they would want to lessen the weight of the ship… but i am sure father knew something very serious had happened and that once away from the ship we would never return. - the daily current-argus, 23 may 1948  not long after this exchange a series of crewmen passed by ordering everyone to get lifebelts and get up on deck. laura immediately returned to her cabin to see her companions; she fetched one lifebelt for herself and distributed the others to her friends, telling them that if they went out into the passageway someone would assist them in putting the garments on. with that, laura left them and rushed back to her father. the identities of laura’s cabinmates is unknown.   laura then states that she and her father moved swiftly and were among the first up on the well-deck, the pair hurrying towards an iron ladder that brought them up into second class, both having to navigate their way over a little gate at the top.   then we went through the saloon and up to the first class staterooms and out on to the deck where the lifeboats were ready to be lowered. as soon as we appeared an officer came up and told father to put the lifebelt on me, which he did at once, and then father told me to go and get as near to the lifeboats as i could. i then left him and neither of us spoke as we expected to meet again. - the daily current-argus, 23 may 1948  it is not clear in which lifeboat laura left the ship, but she does provide some clues:  i was not able to get into the first two lifeboats being lowered, but was put into the third. when we had been lowered about halfway down, one of the pulleys got stuck, and we all thought we should be overturned into the sea, but it started working again just in time to prevent such a calamity. - the daily current-argus, 23 may 1948  laura also claimed that two chinese men, who had rushed up from the steerage, pushed their way through the crowd and jumped into the lifeboat, an officer shooting them both and tossing their bodies over the side.  ",Shop Assistant,3rd Class Passenger,,12,American,https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/laura-may-cribb.html

""i went down with the ship and sank about two fathoms. swam about twenty minutes in the water and was picked up by no. 4. about 1,000 others in the water in my estimation. saw no women. recovered consciousness and found sailor lyons and another lying on top of me dead.""

"DUFF GORDON,  Lucy Christiana, Lady",48,Female,C1,Cherbourg,0,1,56,"        lady duff-gordon (lucy christiana sutherland), 48, was born on 13 june 1863 1, the daughter of douglas sutherland, a toronto engineer. her sister was elinor glyn, the writer. she would later write that she had been christened 'lucy christiana' but that 'all my intimate friends have known me as christiana'.  she was first married, at age 18, to james stuart wallace by whom she had a child. 3 they were divorced in 1888 4 and she was left virtually penniless. 5 in order to make some money to support herself and her child she set up a dressmaking business. in 1894 she rented a shop and workspace at 24 old burlington street, london, between bond street and regent street. 6 'maison lucile' was a success and the 'personality' dresses of 'lucile' were immediately popular. each design was unique which enhanced their appeal. in 1897 new, larger premises were purchased at 17 hanover square. 7 by 1900 the firm had become one of the great couture houses of london under the name 'the maison lucile.' her clientele included margot asquith and the duchess of york (later queen mary). 8 in 1910 she opened a branch of lucile ltd. in new york. a further salon was established in paris in 1912 9, and in 1915 a branch in chicago expanded the empire. 10

		 	   the business was a success but feeling she was not skilled in financial matters, lucy took on sir cosmo duff-gordon as a partner in a shrewd business move. in 1900 they were married. 11 partly because 'lucile' travelled so much, they rarely lived together. between 1906 and 1914 they had a home at 22 lennox gardens, knightsbridge. 12 lucile's paris address was 14 avenue du bois de boulogne while she also had a summer villa, 'pavillon mars' at 4 rue d'angivillers, versailles, only about half a mile from the palace. 13 she had no residence in the united sates and usually stayed at the waldorf-astoria, the ritz-carlton or the plaza. 14 aside from the financial security her husband gave her, lady duff-gordon would later explain how her aristocratic connections would prove more acceptable at court (i.e. before the queen) than before when she was merely a dressmaker, although she was never really accepted at court because of her divorce. 15

uneventful. like everyone else i was entranced by the beauty of the liner. i had never dreamed of sailing in such luxury ... my pretty little cabin, with its electric heater and pink curtains, delighted me, so that it was a pleasure to go to bed. everything about this lovely ship reassured me.  i remember that last meal on titanic very well. we had a big vase of beautiful daffodils on the table, which were as fresh as if they had just been picked. everyone was very gay, and at a neighbouring table people were making bets on the probable time of this record breaking run. various opinions were put forward, but none dreamed that titanic would make her harbour that night ...  i had been in bed for about an hour and the lights were all out, when i was awakened by a funny, rumbling noise. it was like nothing i had ever heard before. it seemed as if some giant hand had been playing bowls, rolling the great balls along. then the boat stopped. 19   lady duff-gordon and her

ladies' day at the titanic inquiry yesterday. expectations of hearing more about the strange tales of 'the money boat' had excited keen interest in the day's proceedings, and the prospect of seeing sir cosmo and lady duff-gordon in court relating their version of the incidents of that tragic vigil in mid-ocean was a compelling attraction to the fair and always curious sex. from floor to topmost gallery the scottish hall was thronged. mrs asquith was an early comer, miss ismay, sister of the much-talked of chairman of the white star line, was an interested auditor. the duff-gordons were in court at 10.30 a.m., and took their seats at the outer end of the first row of advocates. sir cosmo was wearing a black frock coat and light striped trousers, and lady duff-gordon, who is, of course,

"DUQUEMIN, Mr Joseph Pierre",24,Male,C3,Southampton,0,1,7,"        mr joseph pierre duquemin was born in guernsey 1 in the channel islands on 24 november 1887 2.  he was the eldest child of joseph pierre duqemin (b. 1866), a stonemason, and ann louise quentin (b. 1866), both natives of castel, guernsey who had married around 1887. one of ten surviving children from a total of fourteen, joseph's known siblings were: walter (b. 1888), elise (b. 1890), nora (b. 1891), nelson (b. 1893), lillian (b. 1895), harry (b. 1898), florry (b. 1899), adele emilie (b. 1897), rita (b. 1900) and gerald (b. 1904).  joseph and his family appear on both the 1901 and 1911 census records living at port grat in st sampson and by the time of the latter record joseph was described as an unmarried labourer in a quarry.  he boarded the titanic at southampton as a third class passenger (ticket number s.o./p.p. 752 which cost £7 11s) and he was travelling with  howard hugh williams. another friend, albert denbuoy, was travelling in second class. joseph's destination was albion, new york.  on the night of the sinking joseph duquemin aided the women to find lifeboats. at one point he took off his overcoat and wrapped it around a shivering seven-year-old girl eva hart. he claimed that he helped others until he was waist-deep in water before turning to howard williams (some sources say albert denbouy) to tell him that he was jumping. he jumped and made for collapsible d, but his friend fell victim to the suction. joseph said that at first he was refused permission to board the lifeboat but was soon allowed on when he told the crew that he could handle an oar.3 later he claimed to pull another swimmer out of the water. another male passenger in the lifeboat, frederick hoyt, is believed by family to have later assisted duquemin in obtaining work in stamford, connecticut.  news of the sinking reached joseph's family back in guernsey later on that day. his brother gerald related that his mother was in severe shock and a doctor had to be sent for. word of joseph's safety arrived by a telegram, which is reported to have read: ""joseph duquemin reported safe, ismay."" the telegram and envelope are still in the hands of joseph's descendants.  duquemin would never return to his native guernsey and for a time he was plagued by nightmares about the disaster. he also suffered badly from the frostbite in his legs, derived from his time in the water.  arriving in new york and following recuperation joseph went to work in upstate new york before moving to sterling, windham, connecticut in the late 1910s. he later served in the us army as an infantryman following the outbreak of war in europe in 1914-1918. he eventually settled in stamford, connecticut and worked at the yale & towne manufacturing company and, during the 1930s, helped build stamford high school's boyle stadium.  he was married in the 1920s to a connecticut-born irish-american, marion flanaghan (b. 1900) and had two daughters, mary (1929-1976, later mrs robert knapp) and marilyn (1931-1985, later mrs frank marro4) and a son, joseph (b. 1932). the family continued to reside in stamford.  in later years joseph's physical health deteriorated, likely as a result of his frostbite and he would lose two toes to gangrene before both his legs were amputated by the time of the mid-1940s. despite his ailments joseph is remembered as being very strict, honest and independent but the subject of the titanic was rarely discussed in the household. he would often lament, however, over his birthplace of guernsey which he is said to have missed terribly.

they would go on to be the parents of ten children 2 and their first child frank william was born in 1899. the small family appear on the 1901 census living at 29 dock street, southampton and frank was described as a ship's stoker in the royal navy. between that time and the next census frank and mary jane had five daughters: mary maria (b. 1902), elsie emily (b. 1904), kathleen (b. 1906), daisy winifred (b. 1908) and louisa (b. 1910) but would lose their eldest daughter mary before she reached her first birthday.  the 1911 census shows the family living at 3 farmers court, southampton and frank was described as a ship's fireman for the white star line. another son, edward would be born before the close of the year. aside from his seafaring frank was also a professional boxer and remembered by family as a hard man.  when he signed on to the titanic on 6 april 1912, frank gave his address as 3 farmers court and his previous ship as the teutonic. as a fireman he could expect monthly wages of £6.  initially taking in passengers from the boat deck dymond recalled having a lot of trouble keeping men away from the boat and reported a ""foreigner"" clutching a child (franz and manca karun?) which dymond tried taking from him to put in the boat. the man would not release the child and at the last moment dymond permitted the man and child to enter together. he also recalled jostling with another man who had two lifebelts on, managing to commandeer one and give it to a ""little irishman"" who had none.  having taken in passengers and crew from the boat deck the lifeboat was then lowered to a-deck. dymond recalled how the boat was damaged as it was lowered between the two decks by striking the side of the ship. by the time the boat reached a-deck she was swung out about two feet from the ship's side and started taking in more people but a rush ensued and dymond reported striking ""one foreigner"" who clambered aboard. noticing that the boat was full dymond shouted out to lower away and in the confusion he reported several men falling out of the boat and into the sea below.  during the descent dymond heard his mate fred barrett call up from below in boat 13, which had drifted aft and directly under the rapidly descending boat 15. dymond responded by calling out for the crew lowering the boat to stop and the heavily-laden craft halted about six feet from the water. with boat 13 managing to get itself free lifeboat 15dropped with a splash into the ocean, causing water to enter and soaking the lifeboat's occupants.  lifeboat 15 was filled, according to dymond with 68 persons which included he and six other firemen and he, being the only naval man aboard, took command. they drifted aft and dymond noted how the propellers were visible and the stern keel about twelve feet clear of the water. after that the boat drifted to about 300 yards from the titanic. with the boat so heavily laden there was difficulty in rowing and dymond made sure that the boat moved carefully; the gunwales were scarcely 6"" above the waterline and the damage that the boat had acquired during lowering had produced a leak. dymond took the tiller, sometimes being relieved by fireman harry noss, and in the cramped in and cold conditions he started to suffer from the cold, wearing nothing but a flannel sweater and dungarees. a spare sweater he had brought with him was given to trimmer walter fredericks to help keep him warm.  after a while dymond reported hearing an explosion and seeing the ship split and the stern settle back. another explosion occurred which he attributed to the aft boilers bursting and the stern then rose into the air and the lights went out, followed by the horrific noise of everything loose in the ship crashing, mingled with that of the shrieks and cries of those still aboard. the stern section then plunged.  one ""dago"" man in the lifeboat became hysterical and dymond confessed that if he had been able to reach him he would have struck him with the boat's tiller as he was upsetting the other occupants. to try and make themselves visible the boat's occupants burned shirts, handkerchiefs and rags on a boathook.  frank was not required to testify at either the us or british inquiries into the sinking.

"EMANUEL, Miss Virginia Ethel",6,Female,C3,Southampton,0,1,12,"        miss virginia ethel emanuel (martin) was born in manhattan, new york on 6 october 1905.  she was the daughter of john alfred deszo martin 1 (b. 1882) and esther weil 2 (b. 1885). her father, an artist 3, was jewish and hailed from budapest, hungary whilst her mother was born in cincinnati, ohio and was of french and german-jewish heritage. they were married in manhattan on 20 december 1903.  virginia's parents were later divorced and her mother began co-habiting with a man named walter emanuel (b. 1880) although it is not clear if they ever married. walter was vaguely described on the 1910 census as living off of his own means and he, virginia and her mother, now going by the name estelle emanuel, were recorded living at 115 street west, manhattan. her father was back living with his parents at west 150th street and working as a clothing salesman.  virginia's mother was by all accounts an opera singer and she travelled with her to london in early 1912, arriving aboard olympic on 31 january and disembarking at plymouth. estelle travelled in first class whilst virginia travelled in second class, chaperoned by her nursemaid elizabeth dowdell. with estelle reportedly being handed a six month contract for shows in london, virginia was sent back to new york and would again be accompanied by miss dowdell.  virginia and elizabeth boarded titanic at southampton on 10 april 1912, this time travelling as third class passengers (ticket number 364516 which cost £12, 9s, 6d). whilst aboard they shared a cabin with english woman amy stanley.  miss dowdell later recounted (hudson observer, 20 april 1912):  ""i had put ethel to bed, and was preparing to retire myself when the crash came. i went into the passageway and asked a steward what was wrong. he assured me that everything was all right. i went back, to go to bed, but scarcely had i closed the door, when someone came running along the passage, ordering all hands to dress and put on life belts.   ""i took my time in getting ready, not thinking the situation was serious. i firmly believed the titanic was unsinkable. when we tried to get to the deck the stairways were so crowded that we could not get to the deck above. men and women were climbing over each other here, and it was impossible for them to move. they appeared to me to be steerage passengers, and their cries and curses were terrible to hear.   ""finally some of the men passengers realized that it would be impossible to get up by the stairways, and they hoisted the women and children to seamen on the gallery above. they clasped their hands together, to enable the women to step upon them and reach out to those who would grasp them.   a gallant englishman   ""an englishman stepped to my side and picked up my charge. he held her up as high as possible, but she was too small to grasp the hands overhead. finally he stood alongside one of the poles and lifted her to his shoulders. still she could not get up.   ""step on my face, kiddie,"" he said.   ""she did, and was lifted up. then i placed my foot on his two hands and climbed above. the child had her shoes on, too, and his face was frightfully scratched. still, he smiled bravely when he assisted me.   ""'good bye, miss, and good luck,'"" he said.   ""when we arrived on deck nearly all of the boats were off. they were just filling no. 13, and the men and officers were trying to get the canvass off two others. they failed in this, and at last gave up in despair. my charge and i were carried bodily into boat no. 13.   ""several men tried to rush in on us before we were lowered. i saw an officer shoot three of them. the others stopped immediately.   ""the titanic began to list alarmingly. when we reached the water the next boat behind us was coming down, and just missed coming on top of ours. as it was we collided, and for a moment i thought we would overturn.   ""i stated before that we saw the iceberg plainly. after striking, the titanic backed away. when we rowed towards the towering ice mountain i looked and saw the gaping hole in the side of the big ship. the sea rushed in in torrents. our boat was manned with twelve sailors, two at each oar, and it must have been nearly ten minutes before we were free from the suction.   ""no sooner were we off that [sic] the titanic began to go down rapidly. the bow disappeared first. there was no playing by the bands, and only the cries and sobs of those aboard and in the boats was to be heard above the wash of the sea.   ""many aboard the lifeboats, when they saw their dear ones on deck doomed, threw themselves overboard. some had to be forcibly restrained. the last thing i heard was what i believed to be the captain's voice crying 'every man for himself.'   seventy on board   ""while we were rowing about, many came alongside and were pulled aboard. we had seventy in our boat by the time the carpathia picked us up. i do not know how many we took on board at the start.   ""all during this time rockets were being sent up from the doomed vessel. revolver shots added to the din and dying voices. then there was one great explosion. i guessed it was the boilers. the titanic did not stay up long after that, but tilted, bow downward, with a great part of the stern in the air. she stayed for a moment, then plunged under. her lights were burning to the last.   ""one woman from a capsized boat came near to us. she was swimming.   ""'man, let go of me,' she pleaded to someone who was hanging on to her.   "" 'i will not,' responded the masculine voice. 'if i do i will drown.' he did let go, however, and the woman was hauled aboard. she said she had been swimming for an hour, and supporting this unknown man for half of that time.   ""there was one instance of a family of nine, including the mother and father. the men tried to force one of the daughters into the boat, but when she learned that her father and brothers could not be saved, she leaped back on the wave-washed titanic deck. this was in the boat lowered after ours.   ""we were rowing about for hours before being picked up. the men became so tired that we women had to change places with them and row.   ""i was even surprised at my own calmness. i guess it was the responsibility i had in caring for ethel. i worried only about her, for i have been with her a good while and we are attached to each other.""  coming off carpathia in new york virginia and miss dowdell were met by her grandparents, mr and mrs weil and accompanied them to their home at 605 west 113th street, manhattan, eventually being reunited with her father later. her mother returned to new york in august 1912.  following this virginia largely drops off the radar although she was shown arriving in new york in 1916 aboard saratoga. on 1 may 1924 she travelled first class aboard the president roosevelt to new york and was described as a student, her previous address being 5 rex place, park lane, west london. later that year on 4 october she and her mother travelled aboard berengaria, again as first class passengers and again stating their address as 5 rex place; her mother had down-sized her age considerably, describing herself as a student aged 22 (she was in fact 39).

"ETCHES, Mr Henry Samuel",43,Male,Crew,Belfast,1,1,0,"        mr henry samuel etches was born on 12 october 1868 in freemantle, southampton, hampshire, england.   he was the son of john george etches (1829-1887) and caroline elizabeth newman (1833-1902). his father was scottish by birth and his mother was from southampton and they had married in the latter city on 12 may 1853.   one of a dozen children, henry's siblings were: elizabeth maria (b. 1854), sarah isabella (b. 1855), caroline (b. 1857), john george (b. 1859), catherine (b. 1861), mary ann (b. 1863), alice (b. 1865), thomas charles (b. 1867), helen (b. 1870), francis edward (b. 1872) and walter william (b. 1874).  for reasons unknown, henry and his family are not listed on the 1871 census. they appear on the 1881 census as living at 68 park road, millbrook, hampshire when his father was described as a master painter. henry was absent for the 1891 census but his then-widowed mother was living as a boarder at 47 st mary's road, southampton.  described as a steward, etches was married in st anne's church in bermondsey, london on 1 january 1896 to lilian rachel smith (b. 14 may 1873 in pershore, worcestershire), daughter of farmer thomas smith and the former ellen stanley. henry and lilian would remain childless.   by the time of the 1901 census henry is absent but his wife is listed as a visitor at 114 derby road, st mary, southampton. he is again absent at the time of the 1911 census, with his wife then listed as living at 23a gordon avenue, portswood, southampton.  when he signed on to the titanic he gave his address as 23a, gordon avenue, southampton. his previous ship was the oruba and as a bedroom steward, he could expect to earn wages of £3, 15s per month. he was in charge of eight aft portside first-class cabins on b-deck and one (a-36) on a-deck, that of thomas andrews.  during the voyage, etches reported at the cabin of thomas andrews every morning at 7.00 am, describing how mr andrews seemed to be busy all the time working on his new ship. etches stated that andrews had charts rolled up by the side of his bed and papers of all descriptions on his desks and was constantly taking notes on any improvements that could be made. he would see him at other points during the days aboard, mainly on e-deck and always with an entourage, taking notes for improvements.  on sunday 14th april etches had been on watch until 9.00 pm when he turned in, being required back on duty by midnight. he was asleep in his own e-deck quarters amidships when the collision occurred. something stirred him awake but he could not say what it was and called out to his mate ""what time is it that they are going to call us next?"" his mate replied ""i don't know"" and etches turned to go back to sleep again but had only just done so when he heard an ""extra loud"" shout, ""close watertight bulkheads,"" recognising the voice as belonging to boatswain nichols. etches got up and looked out of his quarters and saw nichols and a seaman running up scotland road towards the stern.  etches then began to dress but before finishing doing so again looked out onto scotland road; within this short space of time third-class passengers had started filing aft from the quarters in the bow, many carrying all their belongings. he started out into the corridor for another look and had only walked a few metres when he met a passenger carrying a chunk of ice who asked ""will you believe it now?"" before throwing the article to the deck.   possibly unnerved, etches returned to his quarters to complete dressing after which he went out into the corridor to make his way up top, brushing past bedroom steward edmund stone who was just coming off his watch. etches asked stone the time but stone dismissed the question and said ""never mind about that; there is something else for you to do. i saw them pull up bags of mail, and the water running out of the bottom of them.""   etches then ascended to a-deck and saw the bedroom steward he was supposed to relieve assisting passengers there, most of the cabin doors having been flung open with half-dressed passengers standing around. he asked the steward ""have you called all of your people?"" and the steward replied that he had, retorting ""yes, but i can't get them to dress."" etches then went to b-deck to summon his own charges, including benjamin guggenheim and his manservant victor giglio. etches stated that guggenheim answered his door immediately; the steward entered and took down the lifebelts from the top of the wardrobe. the millionaire quipped ""this will hurt."" to which etches replied ""you have plenty of time, put on some clothes and i will be back in a few minutes."" when etches did return he assisted mr guggenheim into a lifebelt and they left the cabin, passing by cabin b78 (that of the spencers) which he found shut. he banged on the cabin door with both hands and a man's voice answered ""what is it?"" followed by a lady's voice asking ""tell me what the trouble is."" etches advised that they should open the door and he would explain everything, but to please get ready with lifebelts. the cabin's occupants (which he recalled belonged to an american couple, the man being ""a stiff-built gentleman"" and the woman a ""rather short, thin lady"") remained reluctant to open the door and etches moved on.  at around 12.20 etches was still going along b-deck when thomas andrews, who was without a lifebelt of his own, stopped him to ask if he had taken care of all of his passengers; etches stated that he had not and was just about to see if william ernest carter and his family were ready; he went to open their cabin door but was informed by bruce ismay's private secretary william harrison, whose cabin adjoined that of the carter's, that they had already vacated.   andrews then ordered etches to follow him to c-deck, heading down a pantry staircase and asking him to make sure the passengers open their cabin doors and advise them that their lifebelts were on top of the wardrobes and on the top of the racks and to assist them to get them on. the pair walked along c-deck together when they encountered purser mcelroy surrounded by a large group of ladies, he asking them to go back to their rooms and not to frighten themselves but, as a preliminary caution to put their lifebelts on. mr andrews retorted ""that is exactly what i have been trying to get them to do"" and with that he walked down the stairwell to d-deck and that was the last that etches saw of him. purser mcelroy then advised him to head up to the boat deck, which he did, with orders to tell all the other bedroom stewards to assemble their passengers at the boat deck.  etches arrived at the starboard boat deck just as lifeboat 7 was being loaded; he asked the quartermaster if it was lifeboat 5 (his assigned boat) but was told that it was not. he then went to lifeboat 5 which was still being prepared so he assisted in launching lifeboat 7, describing how himself, officers murdoch and pitman, bruce ismay, a quartermaster and two other stewards were present at as the boat was being filled. he described one baby boy (trevor allison?) with a small woollen cap over his head entering the lifeboat.   ",First class bedroom steward,Victualling Crew,,5,English,https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/henry-samuel-etches.html

""... i called the sailors aft, and i passed the remark to them: ""there is people in the water."" i said, ""do you think it advisable?"" i said, ""we can't do nothing with this crowd we have in the boat,"" because we had no room to row, let alone do anything else, sir; and it was no good of our going back. by the time we got back there, we could not have done anything. we could not move in the boat, let alone row. i thought it unsafe to go back there, sir, having so many in the boat.""  haines thought it useless to row anywhere and had the boat remain stationary until daylight. it was with the break of daylight that the lights of the carpathia became visible and all around haines reported numerous icebergs and growlers--between 30 and 50--and an ice field which stretched for several miles.  haines was called to testify at the american inquiry into the sinking before returning to england.  he continued to work at sea until at least the early 1920s and was married in southampton in mid-1914 to florence elsie southwell (b. 9 november 1890), a native of that city. their only child, a son ronald jesse was born on 29 july 1917. the couple later moved to the grosvenor road area of southampton.

he left his room and put his head out of a porthole to see what the ship had struck but could see nothing but he did hear a hissing noise emanating from the vicinity of the forward area under the forecastle head. he went there but again could see nothing but he and a storekeeper (presumably john foley) took the hatch of the storeroom and went down to see if the ship was making water, going down as far as the tank top, but the ship seemed sound. ascending to the forecastle again hemming determined that the hissing sound was coming from an exhaust pipe coming from the forepeak tank. he encountered chief officer wilde and told him of the situation regarding the tank but explained that the storerooms were dry, with the chief officer saying ""all right."" before walking away. he and the storekeeper (whose identity is not clear, presumably john foley) then went back to their bunks and went to sleep.  not asleep for long, the ship's joiner john hutchinson came to his cabin and reported that the ship was taking in water in holds 1, 2 and 3 as well as the racquet court. just as he left the boatswain alfred nichols arrived and told his crew to ""turn out"" and that the ship had half-an-hour to live as per the advice of thomas andrews but not to tell anyone and keep it to themselves.  hemming then made for the boat deck. his assigned lifeboat was number 16 but he started at the foremost boat and worked aft, assisting in swinging them out. officer lightoller soon arrived and he instructed hemming to follow him, bringing him to lifeboat 4 and advising he and another crewman to lower that lifeboat flush with a-deck promenade. he was unable to complete this before he received an instruction from captain smith to go an fetch lamps and place them in the boats.  carrying four lamps at a time, two in each hand which he had lit himself, and totalling fourteen, hemming could not say how many boats he equipped, several having left by that stage.  under second officer lightoller's orders hemming then assisted in filling and lowering collapsible d before assisting in attempting to clear away collapsible b. he then went to the starboard side and assisted with the falls of the davits that had just lowered collapsible c, readying them to launch collapsible a. he worked at the forward davit, seemingly to untangle a knot of rope in the falls which he succeeded in doing before attempting to pass the block up to the roof of the officer's house where collapsible a was stowed with the intention it would be attached to the boat. officer moody refused the block, advising that they would keep the boat on deck, presumably with the intention of floating the craft off. it was around this time (but not clear) that hemming observed captain smith at the bridge who he reported as shouting out for all people to cross to the starboard side.  with no other orders, hemming went forward to the bridge and looked over the side where he saw the water climbing towards him. he then looked out to sea towards starboard and could see nothing but blackness before he crossed to the portside where he spotted a boat (boat 4) a short way off in the distance. he moved aft along the port boat deck before scaling the after falls from a set of davits and slid down into the water, punching out for the boat he had spotted and swimming for it, the boat sitting around 200 yards the from the side of the ship  hemming, who had not had the chance to return to his quarters for a lifebelt, swam for boat 4 and reached it, attempting to pull himself aboard via the grab lines at the bows. finding them too high to do so, he swam amidships and pulled himself up so that his head was visible atop the gunwale. spotting storekeeper john foley standing he said ""give us a hand in, jack"" foley replied ""is that you, sam?"" foley and some other of the boat's occupants helped pull hemming aboard.

"JOHNSTONE, Mr James",52,Male,Crew,Belfast,1,1,0,"        mr james johnstone 1 was born in annan, dumfriesshire, scotland2 on 31 october 1859.3  he was the son of andrew johnstone (b. 1822), a shoemaker, and jane mclean (b. 1832); his father was native to hoddom, dumfriesshire whilst his mother hailed from edinburgh and they were married in annan on 18 june 1852. he had three known siblings: margaret (b. 1853), janet (b. 1855) and jane (b. 1862).   james and his family appear on the 1861 census living on high street, annan, presumably the location of his father's workshop. his mother was deceased by the time of the 1871 census but his father had remarried in 1863 to mary gillespie (b. 1837), a native of st mungo, dumfriesshire. when the 1881 census was conducted only his father and stepmother remained at their high street address; by then james' whereabouts are not certain but it is likely he was already at sea.  he went to sea as a young man and appears on crew manifests as early as 1887 when he was serving as a barman and storekeeper aboard britannia and was still working on her as late as 1889. from 1890 through 1894 he served briefly on city of rome and paris but chiefly aboard orotova as a pantry steward. by 1903 he was 1st second class steward aboard the panama and by that time had already started to shave years from his true age. a circa 1921 crew card gives his year of birth as 1867 and describes him as standing at 5' 9"" and with brown hair and eyes and a dark complexion. he was married in sacred heart church, liverpool on 20 november 1891 to mary frances pinnington (b. 16 january 1866 in liverpool), the daughter of thomas pinnington and mary rigby. they went on to have five children: james andrew (b. 1892), thomas pinnington (b. 1897), florence mary (b. 1899) and twins madeline and olga winifred (b. 1901). his elder son james followed in his footsteps and went to sea as a steward around 1907, serving aboard saxonia for several years.   the family appear on the 1901 census living at 72 fell (?) street, west derby and james is described as a sea steward. their home address by the time of the 1911 census was 96 church road but james was absent, presumably at sea.   james was aboard the titanic for her delivery trip from belfast to southampton; when he signed on for the maiden voyage, on 4 april 1912, he gave his age as 41 and local address as the sailors' home in southampton. his previous ship had been the olympic and as a first-class steward, he could expect monthly wages of £3, 15s. aboard titanic he served as a first-class saloon night watchman and reported for duty every night at 11 pm, taking over from bedroom stewards after they had turned in following their daily shifts.   at the time of the collision, johnstone was situated in the first-class dining saloon, sitting at a table and conversing with colleagues. to him the impact with the iceberg was slight, he believing that the ship had shed a propeller blade; someone in his company remarked that would mean ""another belfast trip."" leaving his table for a look around he crossed paths with a greaser (alfred white) who had come up from below in search of hot water; johnstone asked if he would go below and see what was the matter; white did so and soon returned, telling johnstone that the situation appeared to be serious.  johnstone apparently, although he does not make this clear, remained in the dining saloon; here he saw thomas andrews descend below and presumably into the engine room followed directly by captain smith. when andrews returned from below johnstone followed him back down to e-deck, stuffing four oranges into his pockets before leaving the saloon. on e-deck he went in search of his friend and colleague james toshack who was on watch there and whilst there saw mr andrews descend into the mailrooms; peering in after him he saw water flooding that narrow stairwell.   around 12.10 am johnstone went looking for second steward george dodd but instead met assistant second steward joseph wheat, informing him of the seriousness of the situation. he then went to the glory-hole, changed into his suit and made his way up top; on the way up he saw thomas andrews reassuring some first-class ladies in or around the reception room; on c-deck he saw chief steward andrew latimer, purser hugh mcelroy and two or three officers gathered. having no lifebelt, he once again returned to his quarters to acquire one before remounting the stairs, taking time to have another look at the lifeboat list in the pantry that he had looked at a few days before, just to make sure he had not made a mistake and confirming his lifeboat as emergency boat 2.    upon reaching the boat deck johnstone had a look around; he jumped into lifeboat 2 to check if the plug was in place and everything else was in order; returning to the deck he waited around. a while later the second steward george dodd approached him, asking him to hold his lifebelt and jacket; he never saw him again after that.   later chief officer wilde also approached him and asked ""what boat do you belong to,"" and johnstone responded that it was number 2. wilde consulted a list, confirming that and asked ""can you pull [an oar]?"" and johnstone confirmed that he could; wilde then ordered him to stand by the falls. by that point a group of about 8 or 10 firemen had gathered near the boat; johnstone asked if they belonged to number 2 but they were hesitant and unsure. an officer (boxhall) jumped into the boat then handed him a lamp and johnstone then climbed in after; he saw a loaf of bread and tin of biscuits on the deck but could not say if they made their way into the boat after them.   johnstone stood in the boat at the forward fall and asked a fireman or trimmer4 on the deck for a knife, he pre-empting that he might need it to release the boat following lowering; the man handed him a razor. soon after chief officer wilde began filling the boat with women and children, a process which johnstone estimated took about 15 minutes. despite the large number of people gathered, many women among them, johnstone indicated a reluctance of many of them to leave and he saw numerous women depart from the vicinity of lifeboat 2 and descend to a-deck, he believing that they did not sense the urgency of the situation.  taking on what johnstone estimated to be 23 to 25 people, far from its capacity, lifeboat 2 was lowered down a few feet to become flush with a-deck to see if any more passengers wanted to come aboard; he reported none came forward and the boat was lowered jerkily into the water, he reporting that the razor that he had been handed by another crewman proved helpful in releasing her to the water. after that those manning the oars pulled for two lights, red and white, off in the distance from the port bow. he reported one foreign man in the boat (anton kink) and one seaman (frank osman) and a cook (john ellis) as well as officer boxhall; the rest were women and children. one ""girl"" took the tiller under the direction of boxhall who, in turn, was assisting anton kink at an oar.   soon the lights they were pulling towards, after making about a mile and a half from titanic, disappeared. after this they made their way toward the starboard stern of the ship, standing off about 800 yards; boxhall then asked the ladies in the boat if they should return but they declined. johnstone recalled hearing a swish of water and, looking around, saw an iceberg close to their lifeboat. boat 2, smaller than the standard boats and with a small compliment, moved easily through the water; armed with a lamp and what johnstone reported as roman candles, it became a beacon for other lifeboats. as day was breaking johnstone saw the carpathia approach.   johnstone was called to give evidence over two days at the british inquiry into the sinking, standing in the same suit he had worn to leave titanic.

"JONSSON, Mr Karl",25,Male,C3,Southampton,0,1,7,"        mr karl jonsson was born in loushult, kristianstad, sweden on 12 may 1886.  he was the son of johan nilsson (b. 15 december 18501 in stockhult), a railway worker, and ingrid (née nilsson (b. 3 august 18542 in vissefjärda). his known siblings were: an unnamed child (b. 3 july 1877), blenda sofia (b. 20 september 1878), emil (b. 18 may 1880), ida (b. 9 december 1881), otto viktor (b. 15 august 1883), oskar bernard nikolaus (b. 5 november 1887), blenda maria (b. 18 november 1889), anna matilda (b. 14 march 1891), klara (b. 17 march 1893) and axel (b. 14 may 1894).  he left loushult sometime around 1906 and settled in malmö where he worked as a railway brakeman.  travelling from kvilleberga, sweden via denmark jonsson purchased his ticket for the titanic in copenhagen (ticket number 350417 which cost £7, 17s, 1d). he boarded at southampton as a third-class passenger with his travelling companions pål andreasson, albert augustsson, nils johansson and his sister in law olga lundin. the american senate list gave his destination as huntley, illinois.  he survived the sinking, arriving in new york aboard the carpathia and listing his next of kin as his father in sweden and his destination being that of his employer, c. a. smith sawmill in camden, minneapolis, minnesota which is where he travelled to after being given $25 by the woman's relief committee in new york.  in one known contemporary interview provided by jonsson (albeit via an interpreter), the method of his survival is questionable; there is a possibility he escaped after swimming to collapsible a or b, or he may have simply left the ship in one of the functioning lifeboats. like several survivors he—or the newspaper interviewing him—tried to implicate one of the astors in his survival.   reaching minnesota karl jonsson gave an interview to the minneapolis star tribune (1 may 1912). already in full employment with the c. a. smith lumber company , he was described as a strapping “powerful man, 6 feet 3 inches tall, and weigh[ing] 205 lbs. he is 26 years old. he said all he had when he reached new york was a picture of the young woman in sweden to whom he is engaged and two swedish pennies.” despite his ordeal, it was stated that he carried no ill effects and was a picture of perfect physical health, having been given modest monetary assistance as well as new shoes and clothes. the article also states that it was his original intention of heading to alaska when he joined titanic.   he spoke of his travelling companions: “with me were my cousin and three young companions. besides these four i became acquainted on the boat with two swedish girls who were coming to america.”  speaking of the collision with the iceberg, he said “i heard nothing of the ship striking. i was sound asleep in my birth and was awakened by the water when it flooded the bed. i jumped out and waded to the upper deck. the ship was sinking fast. the bow was down and the stern was high in the air. i found my friends. we all put on life preservers. we decided to stick together.   when we went under the four boys and myself were holding hands and the two girls were clinging to my coat. it felt as though a current drew us toward the stern of the ship. when i came to the surface i was alone. the water was ice cold and we had been unable to cling together. i looked up and saw the propeller of the titanic high above my head. people were floating and struggling all about me and the screaming was terrible.   there was a loud explosion. i saw something hurled from titanic make straight for me. i feared it would strike me in the head and kill me. it was a large door blown from the ship and it splashed in the water close by. i grabbed it and climbed onto it. i floated for six hours and a half, drifting near a boat. i wanted to be taken in but they seemed afraid. but a woman, whom i was told was mrs astor, reached me her hand and a ship’s officer dragged me aboard.”  jonsson goes on to contradict himself in the same interview when he gives a slightly more plausible version of events, even if still debatable: “i had a fight in the water when i tried to join six men sitting on a collapsible boat. i wanted to take hold of the end of it, but one fellow kicked at me. he struck me in the arm just below the shoulder. i got mad and grabbed his leg and hung to it until daylight.”  a few weeks later the minneapolis star tribune (20 may 1912) reported that well-wishers in his tight-knit swedish community had a fundraiser for him, raising him $100 and surprising him with the donation at a meeting held at the swedish brothers’ hall on 4th street and 7th avenue in the city.  what karl jonsson did over the following decades remains uncertain; there has been the suggestion that he married an oregon-born woman jenny ingram (b. circa 1897) in june 1920, but having no children and eventually divorcing after having spent the 1920s and 1930s living at different addresses in oregon in douglas county and later clatsop county where this “carl johnson” worked as a head breakman on logging trains, a profession that would not have been unfamiliar with the man who had been on the titanic.   what we do know of karl jonsson is that he did indeed work with the railroad before settling in blachly, lane county, oregon in the last fifteen years of his life where he worked for the blachly-lane electric cooperative until his retirement. he was a familiar presence at nearby triangle lake, becoming friendly with many in the community and often recanting his story of the titanic in the thick-swedish accent that he retained for the rest of his life. “ja, it vas turrible, turrible! i shall nev-er forget it!” he would say of the disaster, friends remembered. those same friends related, second-hand, his experiences and his wish to join the mining adventure in alaska when he boarded titanic.  they confirmed that he had been married and divorced but had no children.  ",General Labourer,3rd Class Passenger,,,Swedish,https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/carl-jonsson.html

also travelling with them was the countess' cousin gladys cherry and whilst aboard she was allocated cabin b79. she later recounted that as the titanic was departing southampton she almost collided with another vessel, the new york. many took this as a bad omen and roberta also recalled how a large flock of seagulls followed the ship out to sea, this being, she was told, another bad omen. she had no time for superstitions however and instead busied herself caring for her employer and exploring the ship and making new acquaintances.  family state that roberta and a young crewman became fond of each other during the voyage but his identity is not known; he gave her a ""titanic"" badge or brooch, which she always kept with her in later life.  another acquaintance she made was of an older man whom she did not name and who had taken a paternal interest in her. the man, travelling alone, appeared to be lonely and on the evening of sunday 14 april, she met him again in the lounge where the orchestra were playing tunes such as ave maria and nearer my god to thee. he was full of foreboding which made roberta uncomfortable; at around 10 o'clock she tried to excuse herself for bed but he pleaded with her to stay. she eventually managed to get to bed and never saw the man again.  roberta was in bed at the time of the collision and related how she felt the impact. a steward soon appeared at her door, telling her 'miss we have struck an iceberg, but i don't think there's any danger. should there be i'll come back and let you know.' she returned to bed to try to get back to sleep but the same steward returned, asking her not to be afraid but to dress and put on her lifejacket and go out on deck.  roberta was rescued in lifeboat 8 alongside her employer the countess of rothes and gladys cherry.  after their arrival in new york on board the carpathia the party stayed at the plaza hotel on fifth avenue. whilst there roberta wrote a poem all about her experience of the sinking.  meanwhile, news of the tragedy slowly filtered through to roberta's family at manor farm in surrey. her sisters were walking to the village when they were told the news and when they raced home and told their mother adelaide the news, she fainted. it was reportedly three weeks before roberta's mother knew that her daughter was safe. roberta's surname had been spelled incorrectly on the passenger lists as ""miss maloney"". eventually the white star line confirmed she was one of the survivors.   	 		 			mrs maioni, manor farm, surrey 			replying to your favour of the 17th inst. we are pleased to inform you that amongst the lists of those saved appears the name of miss maioni, which is no doubt your daughter, and we congratulate you on the fact of her safety. 			yours faithfully 			white star line  		 	   when roberta was reunited with her family, her once beautiful hair was reportedly in tatters, much of it torn and pulled as she caught it while taking her turn rowing the lifeboat. in 1926 roberta wrote a personal account of her experience on the titanic for a short story competition run by the daily express.  she was married in st matthew's church, brixton, london on 24 may 1919 to cunliffe lawrance bolling (b. 26 december 1898) of wimbledon, surrey. bolling, was the son of richard bolling and annie amelia, née lawrence, the latter of who's father was a confectioner. cunliffe later worked as a business consultant and had his office at 7 park lane, west london;

"MOORE, Mr George Alfred",32,Male,Crew,Southampton,1,1,0,"          mr george alfred moore was born in enfield, middlesex, england on 26 january 1880.  he was the son of george moore (b. 1857), a railway porter, and his wife emily ""emmey"" wareham (b. 1859).  his father was originally from ponders end, middlesex whilst his mother hailed from freemantle, southampton and they had married in croydon in 1878. george had three known siblings: emily (b. 1882) arthur (b. 1885) and harry (b. 1888).  he first appears on the 1881 census living with his parents at 4 kent road, millbrook, hampshire and would later be recorded on the 1891 census living at 59 graham road, st mary, southampton. he would be absent from the 1901 census, likely at sea, when his family were living at 19 graham road, st mary. george had served at sea since the age of 15.  george was married in southampton in late-1904 to eliza patterson, née curson (b. 1871), native of wandsworth, middlesex. eliza had a previous marriage in 1890 to william walter patterson and had four known children: william walter (1891-1891), william henry (b. 1893), henrietta kate (b. 1895) and doris mabel (1898-1904). she was widowed sometime after 1901 and her remarriage to george moore produced four children: arthur (b. 1906), william (b. 1907), iris (b. 1911) and ernest (b. 1913). the family appear on the 1911 census living at 51 graham road, southampton and george is described as a seaman.  when he signed-on to the titanic, on 6 april 1912, george gave his address as 51 graham road, (southampton) and his previous ship as the plassy. as a lookout he received monthly wages of £5. on the day of departure, 10 april 1912, george described a boat drill taking place at mid-day involving all able seamen where two boats were swung out and lowered.  on the night of the sinking moore was off-watch and in bed when he described a noise like ""a cable running out, like a ship dropping anchor. there was not any shock at all."" boatswain alfred nichols soon arrived at the seamen's quarters ordering them above and george went to his assigned boat station. he assisted in lowering lifeboats 5 and 7 and then assisted in swinging out lifeboat 3 after which he was ordered into the same lifeboat by first officer murdoch to assist the entrance of the ladies. when no more ladies were available or willing to enter the boat, moore admitted accepting male passengers and he believed there were around 32 people in the boat when it was lowered.  moore took charge of the lifeboat at the tiller when it was lowered at about 1.00am and watched as the ship sank from about a quarter of a mile away, describing how titanic seemed to split in half during her final throes and hearing two explosions.  george was later called to testify at the us inquiry into the sinking. when pressed as to why his lifeboat did not return to the scene to pick up any of those struggling in the water, he stated that many of the passengers in the boat were staunchly against any notion of returning, fearing they would be swamped. he also explained that the cries they heard lasted for only a short time and for the time taken to row back would have been too late anyway.  following the disaster george continued to work at sea. he was called up for military service in 1914, prior to war breaking out, and served on armed merchant ships, one of them being the teutonic. he was subsequently the gunner on a merchant vessel and in that occupation he travelled the world. he was discharged from service in 1918 at the end of world war one following which he worked on the olympic which was repatriating the canadian forces. by 1920 he was serving as a crew member for the p&o company. on passage back from india he was found to have contracted smallpox, so at aden, yemen he was put ashore. conditions for him there were very basic; he slept in the open except for a thatched roof over his head and a boy would bring his food and a priest would call out to him to see if he was well. despite this he recovered, in all probability these experiences shortened his life. after returning home he finished his working life in southampton docks on the shore bosuns gang, working for the cross-channel boats.  in later years he moved to totton, hampshire, living at allandale, testwood lane. due to a combination of cardiac and liver problems, george passed away aged 63 on 19 march 1943 at the fenwick hospital.  he was cremated at south stoneham crematorium and his ashes were scattered in the garden of rest, south stoneham, southampton.  family remember george as a hardworking man and, despite his hard life, was an easy-going and amicable man who made few demands on anyone.

"MOORE, Mr J.",29,Male,Crew,Southampton,0,1,0,"        mr j. moore   in southampton, on 10 april 1912 a hampshire-born j. moore signed-on for titanic's maiden voyage. he gave his age as 30, his previous ship as the trent and his local address as 64 arthur road1 in southampton. as a fireman, he could expect monthly wages of £6.   j. moore survived the sinking but was not required to give any evidence to either the british or american inquiries into the disaster. he stealthily slipped into the mists of time and his identity remains uncertain.   during the 1990s in the united kingdom, previously unavailable records were made public, including hundreds of seaman records, most of which were adorned with a mug-shot. this proved tantalising for titanic researchers, with many surviving titanic crew members gaining a face whilst others were, for whatever reason, overlooked. some were even misidentified, with j. moore, it would appear, being among those men. one such identification document, of a man named john moore who was born in southampton on 5 june 1882 became accepted as the very man who had walked the decks of titanic and survived. there was one detail that most overlooked, however; this j. moore was no fireman, but a sailor. it is unlikely, though not impossible, that this j. moore was the same man who was on titanic.  to identify the real j. moore who was on titanic is no easy feat. what is surprising though is that the name moore is surprisingly uncommon in the county hampshire and searches for birth records of any male named j. moore between 1870 and 1890 bring a compact set of results. one individual, however, sticks out. whilst it is not entirely certain that this individual is the same person who was aboard titanic, there is a very high possibility, bordering on positive. here is that man's story.    james moore was born in southampton, hampshire, england on 13 march 1883.  he was the son of alfred moore (b. 1850), a dock labourer, and anna arnold (b. 1850), both southampton natives who had married in 1873. his known siblings were: alfred thomas (b. 1873), anna charlotte (b. 1875), john charles (b. 1877), jane (b. 1878), alexander (b. 1880), lucy (b. 1882), maria (b. 1885) and helen (b. 1889).

"MāMā, Mr Hannā Mikā'īl",20,Male,C3,Cherbourg,0,1,7,"         mr hannā mikā'īl māmā was born near zghartā, al shamal, lebanon on 10 february 1892 1 before moving to tripoli, lebanon in later years2.  he was the son of max māmā and he is known to have had several siblings. he lived in tripoli where he worked as a farm labourer and it has been suggested that he and his family originally hailed from kfar hātā, zghartā although there are reports that they were from ehden.  apparently financially comfortable in his native lebanon, hannā had fallen in love with the daughter of neighbours, a girl named jasmine butrus (betros). she and her family left lebanon around 1909 after which hannā was inconsolable and spent his time with jasmine's brother tannūs butrus-kawi who had remained behind. he tended his olive grove, cultivated silkworms and went shooting to distract his sorrow but when tannūs butrus-kawi made plans to join the rest of his family in america hannā eagerly decided to accompany him, seeking jasmine's hand in marriage, with the young woman's family in approval of the betrothal.   reportedly before leaving lebanon an aged maronite monk, who lived among the cedars of mount lebanon gave māmā a relic which the monk is said to have prized above anything else in the world. the relic, a small locket, was said to contain a piece of the cross on which christ was crucified. the monk assured māmā that if he remained in a state of grace he would be saved from peril both by land and sea if he carried the relic on his person.   having started his journey from his home on 25 march, māmā boarded the titanic in cherbourg as a third class passenger (ticket number 2677 which cost £7, 4s, 7d) having made the voyage from beirut to marseille. his destination was to

including the nakid family. as the ship set sail from cherbourg māmā clutched his chest to make sure he still had the locket around his neck, secured to his person by a piece of strong cord. whilst aboard the ship he enjoyed the company of many of his fellow lebanese passengers.   māmā survived the sinking, possibly in one of the aft starboard lifeboats (possibly 15). he related that he managed to get to the upper decks and fell in prayer at the feet of father byles. the story that came down through the family was that he had been picked up out of the water by mrs astor's boat but there is no evidence to support the claim.   reaching new york aboard the carpathia, māmā was described as a 20-year-old unmarried farmer, stating his point of contact as his father max in tripoli. his intended destination was to 1001 ellsworth street, philadelphia, the home of thomas butrus, described as a cousin.   arriving in the syrian colony in philadelphia māmā was reunited with his family and friends where he was later interviewed by the press. in an interview reprinted in the calgary herald hannā māmā related his story of survival which he credited to his carrying of his holy relic. the article also stated that māmā and jasmine butrus were to wed in st maron's church. whether they ever wed remains uncertain.  hanna, who had anglicised his name to john mami (still listed as mama in some records), was married in new jersey in 1914 to a woman named elizabeth ""lizzie"" starr (b. circa 1892)(3) who was born to sarkis and katherine starr, syrian migrants.  the couple had no children and by the time of john's circa 1917 draft registration the couple had an address in washington, dc, with he being described as a self-employed man standing at 5' 6"" and with black hair, brown hair and a dark complexion. they appear on the 1920 census living at 929 ellsworth street, philadelphia with his wife's parents and he was described as a shipyard labourer. having become a naturalised citizen in 1927, by 1930 john and his wife were living at 1124 south 10th street, philadelphia and mami was described as a dry goods proprietor. at the same address for the 1940 census, mami then had no stated profession.   mami initially worked as a grocer before operating a public house, titanic cafe, until his license was revoked for buying $1200 worth of stolen alcohol.   court rules on liquor license  pittsburgh, april 16--(up)--the state superior court today reversed a ruling of the philadelphia common pleas court that revoked the license for the titanic cafe, operated by john mami, at 1124 south tenth street philadelphia.  the state liquor control board had revoked mami's license when 731 bottles of whisky, stolen from the schwenksville liquor store july 28, 1939, were found on his licensed premises.  mami appealed the board's ruling and the common pleas court changed the revocation to a 90-day suspension. the liquor board appealed from the ruling and he superior court held the common pleas court erred because no evidence altering the board's findings had been produced.  (delaware county daily times, 16 april 1941)  placed on probation for five years, mami then ran an ice-cream parlour before moving to washington, dc in the mid-1940s where he operated a pool room.

""i happened to be looking at the lights on the standing compass and was trimming them so that they would burn properly - then i heard the report...and was just entering the bridge when the shock came."" he heard a 'grinding sound and then saw the berg, which he later described as ""...about the height of the boat deck; if anything, just a little higher. it was almost alongside the boat. it was not white...it was a kind of dark blue hue.""  he remembered the officer giving an order to ""hard aport"" as he entered the wheelhouse with sixth officer moody standing next to hichens to make sure the order was carried out. questioned at the us senate hearings regarding this, one senator asked if he meant ""hard astarboard"" to which he replied, ""no, hard a'port was the only order he heard given."" however, he did not know anything of what had transpired before his arrival.  olliver also testified that the watertight doors had been closed at the bridge.  ""the first officer closed the watertight doors...just after she struck and (he) reported to the captain that they were closed. i heard that myself.""  right after this, the order was given to stop the engines. olliver was then ordered to go find the carpenter and have him take a draft of the water. when he found the carpenter, on e deck, he was already doing it.  he then took a message to the chief engineer in the engine room who told him to tell captain smith he would 'get it done as soon as possible'. by this time, the stokers were coming out of the stoke rooms into the working alleyway. olliver then delivered the message to the captain. it was right after this that the chief officer sent him to the boatswain to tell him to uncover the lifeboats and make them ready for lowering.  after carrying out these orders, olliver then went down to lifeboat 5, where third officer pitman was in charge and was ordered in the boat. he recounted that there were about 40 in lifeboat 5; other crew members, besides himself and pitman, were two firemen, two stewards and a sailor, the rest were women and children. olliver tried to make sure the plug was in the boat but all the passengers kept stepping on him, hampering his efforts and he had to beg them to make way. ""if not for that, the boat would've been swamped.""  the waterline of the titanic was, by his account, about 15 to 20 feet at the bow by this time. after the lifeboat was in the water, olliver took an oar and helped row. testifying later at the us senate hearings, olliver backed up pitman's story that the third officer wanted to go back for survivors but ""the women passengers implored him not to go because they reckoned it was not safe.""  as the ship went under, the titanic ""was well down at the head first...and to my idea, she broke forward, and the afterpart righted itself and made another plunge."" he then heard several small explosions which he reckoned were the bulkheads giving away. by this time, he estimated they were about 500 yards off and began to hear cries and screams people in the water; this lasted for about ten minutes. later, he recounted that their lifeboat was the fourth or fifth picked up by the carpathia.

"OSMAN, Mr Frank",27,Male,Crew,Southampton,1,1,0,"        mr frank osman was born in alverstoke, hampshire, england on 28 march 1885.1  he was the son and youngest child of william osman (1848-1902), a brewery worker and later publican, and emma ""emily"" kate gue (1847-1905), both hailing from romsey, hampshire and who had married in salisbury, wiltshire on 5 november 1868.  frank had five siblings: frances emily (b. 1870), alice jane (b. 1873), florence eliza ann (b. 1875), percy curtis (b. 1878) and william fred (b. 1882). frank first appears on the 1891 census when he and his family were living at 93 avenue road in alverstoke, hampshire. by the time of the 1901 census the family lived at 14 cobden street, alverstoke but frank was absent, having already commenced a career at sea.  initially working as a bricklayer, osman went to sea at age 14 and joined the british navy at age 16 (although he stated he was a year older at the time) in april 1900. he was described as standing at 5’ 5” and with dark brown hair, blue eyes and fair complexion. he served as a general deck boy until promotion to seaman whilst serving aboard juno in september 1906. just over three years later he had attained able seaman status and served aboard a host of ships, including firequeen, formidable and excellent, winding up his naval career with an exemplary record of conduct whilst aboard britannia, having been invalided from service in june 1911. he then immediately joined the white star line, serving aboard the oceanic.  during this time frank had married in alverstoke in 1907 to clara kate sherwin (b. 15 december 1884 in gosport), a tailoress and the daughter of labourer james sherwin and the former kate glover.  frank and clara went on to have seven children: percy frank (1909-1976), frank (1911-1911), maud2 (1912-1993), william james (1915-1992), emily kate3 (1920-2003), grace frances4 (1924-1993) and george joseph (1928-1998).  frank would be absent from the 1911 census but his wife and first two children appear living at 27 zetland road, gosport.  when osman signed-on to the titanic on 6 april 1912 he gave his address as the 43 high street, southampton. his ship prior to titanic had been the oceanic and as an able seaman he received monthly wages of £5.   at the time of the collision osman was situated outside the seaman’s mess on c-deck, waiting for the bell to chime to signal the start of his shift. instead of the usual bell he heard three bells chime, which he took to mean a ship was ahead, and shortly after he felt the impact with the iceberg. he went out onto the forward well deck and saw large amounts of ice, he fetching a piece and returning with it to his quarters on d-deck. on his descent he noticed that the ship had already developed a slight but noticeable list to starboard. soon orders had filtered down that all seamen had to go up top and clear the lifeboats; osman and his mates all made their way to the boat deck.  reaching the boat deck osman assisted in the loading and lowering of three starboard lifeboats and one on the portside. he then left the ship late in the proceedings in lifeboat 2 and stated that first officer william murdoch directed the loading of that boat. describing the boat as holding between 25 and 30 bodies in all, he stated that the boat’s occupants consisted of himself, a ship’s cook (john ellis), a steward (james johnstone) and fourth officer joseph boxhall, as well as one male passenger (anton kink), the rest being made up of women and children.  by his own account lifeboat 2 was easily and steadily lowered and had no trouble during the night, except for one first-class woman who “was worrying.” osman suggested to boxhall that they remain alongside the ship to see if they could “squeeze any more hands in,” to which the officer agreed, a suggestion that made the women in the boat nervous and to which they disagreed.   lifeboat 2 then made its way around to the starboard side of the ship and headed aft, coming astern and with the oarsmen laying on their oars and from where they watched the ship founder, at what he estimated to be between 60 and 100 yards away. osman stated that when the ship reached a certain angle “she exploded, broke in halves, and it seemed to me as if all the engines and everything that was in the after part slid out into the forward part, and the after part came upright again, and as soon as it came up, right down it went again.” he noted that smoke, steam and coal lumps burst out of the funnels as the ship broke apart, attributing that to the seawater making the boilers explode. despite this, he stated that there was no suction whatsoever.   lifeboat 2 was found to have had a box of rockets so boxhall fired a couple off. osman also recalled seeing a light in the distance which he took to be a masthead light of sailing vessel that seemed to disappear as if “she sailed right away.”  as daylight broke osman recalled seeing an iceberg that he believed was responsible for sinking the titanic, describing it as being 100’ tall and being “round, and then had one big point sticking up on one side of it.” he also noted how the berg appeared to have had a piece freshly broken off.   when questioned as to why lifeboat 2 did not return to the wreck site to pick up people in the water, he said the lifeboat was almost full and barely had room to take any more, contradicting his same testimony.  frank was called to testify at the us inquiry into the disaster on 30 april 1912. he was not required to testify at the british inquiry but did receive expenses of £5, 1s with regards to his detention.   frank returned to his family in england and continued to work at sea, joining with the royal naval reserve in october 1913 and serving aboard numerous voyages. with the outbreak of wwi he remained with the naval fleet and served as a leading seaman aboard benbow between october 1914 and december 1917 and was with the grand fleet in the north sea and served during the battle of jutland. he was decorated for his service.   following the war osman rejoined the merchant fleet and served on various ships for the white star and cunard lines, including homeric and mauretania and olympic, working aboard the latter for a considerable time as an assistant storekeeper.    frank osman c.1921  in 1934 osman left the sea and, like his father before him, became a publican, taking over the licence of the cyprus inn at royal crescent in southampton. when that venture folded after only a year he took over the licence of the queen’s hotel in albert road, southampton around the beginning of 1936 and where he worked for the rest of his life.    frank osman in later years (courtesy of ewbanks)  in the last six months of his life frank osman had been in ill health with issues with his heart and blood pressure, suffering two minor strokes during that time. not long after the onset of his physical ill-health osman began to show signs of a downturn in his mental wellbeing, such as being afraid to go outdoors as he had fears of collapsing in public; he also started to show signs of depression and became increasingly irritable, but showed few signs of being suicidal.   on 8 june 1938 frank was, according to his wife, working in the pub as normal and up to a quarter of an hour before his death was serving customers and being jovial, even joking with them. following a brief absence from the bar frank’s wife found him hanging by a rope from a beam in the cellar of their pub. aged 53 years, frank osman had taken his own life and a coroner’s report stated that his death was “suicide while the balance of his mind was disturbed.”  frank osman is buried in st mary's extra cemetery, southampton (section h46, plot 20).

his only identifiable siblings, as per census and birth records, were: kate elizabeth (b. 1877), jesse (b. 1879), william frederick (b. 1881), george edward (b. 1883), alfred henry (b. 1885), ethel bella may (b. 1889), daisy evelyn (b. 1891), leonard walter (b. 1893) and bertie earl (b. 1895).  albert first appears on the 1891 census when he and his family were living at 28 winchester road, south stoneham, hampshire. appearing on the 1901 census and by then living at 23 kent road, portswood he was described as a gardener's boy, apparently already having left school. by the time albert appeared on the 1911 census he was still living at home and unmarried, still at 23 kent road, and he was described as a steward in the white star line, having been in their employment since around 1907. in 1909, however, he had migrated to the usa aboard oceanic and declared his intention to become a us citizen. that never came to fruition, for unknown reasons.      (albert's signature, 1909 us citizenship records)  when he signed-on to the titanic on 4 april 1912 pearcey gave his address as 23 kent road, southampton. his previous ship had been the olympic and as a pantry steward he received monthly wages of £4.  pearcey was off-duty at the time of the collision and standing with others outside the pantry on f-deck. he did not feel any violent jarring at the time of impact, merely a small skip of motion and nothing more to be thought about. soon however news was filtered down that watertight doors were to be closed and he and his colleagues set about manually closing the watertight doors in that section located just aft of the third class dining saloon. after completing this task further orders came (from chief third class steward james kieran?) that the passengers were to be assisted to the boat deck.  pearcey circulated among his charges, all male third class passengers filing aft down scotland road, and assisted them into their lifebelts and passing them through the emergency door into the forward first class stairwell, directing them to ascend right to the top of the stairwell to the boat deck. he and a few other stewards continued at this until no more passengers were in sight, after which he ascended the forward first class stairwell with his fellow stewards, arriving at the boat deck just before 1.30 am, noting how his assigned lifeboat, number 3, had already been launched.  shortly after his arrival at the boat deck, pearcey related that he seen two (unidentified, or if they even existed) babies on the deck; he reportedly collected them into his arms and took them to collapsible c. reaching that boat, first officer murdoch ordered him into the craft to look after the two children, pearcey describing the boat filled with women, children, three firemen, a quartermaster (rowe) and himself, the boat's compliment being 71 persons, seemingly an exaggerated figure. once the boat was launched, pearcey giving the time as approximately 1.40 am, he gave up his two infant charges to some passengers whilst he took an oar.   pearcey survived the sinking and was later required to give evidence at the british inquiry into the disaster, later receiving expenses of £8, 12, 6d. his brusque and sometimes confused answers to his examiners perhaps inform that he was still very touched by his experiences.     albert returned to sea, later working as a ship's baker and steward. in 1914 he arrived in québec aboard the empress of britain, the manifest stating that he then crossed into the usa. according to his circa 1921 merchant navy identification card he was 5' 6"" and had brown hair, grey eyes and a dark complexion. by 1920 through 1922 he was assistant steward aboard aquitania and later saw brief spells as steward aboard olympic in 1923 before returning to aquitania aboard which he was recorded as working as late as march 1925 as an assistant baker.   details about his later private life are largely unknown or uncertain; he was recorded as having married in southampton in early 1918 to ella v. lee, of whom nothing is known. there are no records as to whether they had any children.  following the titanic disaster pearcey had at least two run-ins with the law; in august 1918 he was charged with absenteeism under the military service act.   claimed by the military at the southampton police-court yesterday albert percey, of oak tree road, bitterne park, wearing the uniform of a ships steward a man with three service chevrons on his sleeve, but described on the charge-sheet as baker, was charged with being an absentee under the military service act. it appeared that pearcey had signed on recently on one of the white star vessels, but sent a telegram that he was called away owing to sickness, and missed his ship. two or three days later he made an application to the local tramways for employment without success. after losing his ship and his wages, owing to illness, defendant secured work with local baker for a few days, in order to learn a little money at his own trade. altogether he only worked five days there. the chairman said that after that evidence they saw no alternative but to hand defendant over to the military authorities as an absentee. this was the unanimous decision of the court. - hampshire advertiser, 17 august 1918  seaman and army service the question of whether a seaman still under articles was liable to military service was raised at southampton on friday, when albert pearcey, ship’s steward, was charged with being an absentee under the military service act. defendant, who was stated be a titanic survivor, had been going to sea for 21 months, but, missing his ship owing to illness, obtained work at his old trade as a baker. the magistrates helld that they had no alternative but hand him over to the military authorities as an absentee. - western mail, 17 august 1918  later on 9 april 1925 he was convicted of larceny and sentenced to twelve months imprisonment. whilst not certain, this last act possibly curtailed his sea-going career and by the time of the 1939 register he was described as an unmarried temporary postman and living at 33 commercial street, southampton, the home address of mary ann mayzes, surviving fireman thomas mayzes' widow. after this he drops off the radar until his death was recorded in southampton in the third quarter of 1952. he was buried in south stoneham cemetery (section r 4, plot 201).    ",Pantry Steward (3rd Class),Victualling Crew,,,English,https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/albert-victor-pearcey.html

"PEUCHEN, Major Arthur Godfrey",52,Male,C1,Southampton,1,1,30,"        major arthur godfrey peuchen, 52, was born in montreal, quebec, on 18 april 1859, the son of godfrey peuchen of westphalia, prussia and eliza eleanor clark of hull, england. his father had been a railroad contractor in south america, and his grandfather had managed the london, brighton and midlands railway.  peuchen was educated at montreal private schools. he moved to toronto in 1871 where he enlisted in the queen's own rifles: lieutenant in 1888, captain, 1894 and major, 1904. in 1911 he served as marshalling officer at the coronation of george v. he was also the president of the standard chemical company (1897-1914), one of the first in the world to manufacture acetone (used to make explosives) from wood. it was stated that he owned large forest reserves near hinton, alberta. he also oversaw the operations of the mclaren lumber company, located near blairmore, alberta.  arthur peuchen married margaret thompson in 1893 the daughter of john thompson, of orillia, ontario. together they had a son and a daughter.  although he had a house at 599 jarvis st., toronto he considered ""woodlands"", his mansion on lake simcoe, home. it was an estate complete with a marina, tennis courts and golf course. peuchen had his own yacht, vreda, and when john hugo ross lived in toronto, he had been part of its crew. peuchen was, for a time, vice-commodore and rear commodore of the royal canadian yacht club, toronto. he was also a member of various clubs including the national, toronto; the hunt, toronto; the ontario jockey; the albany, toronto and the military institute, toronto.  with company refineries in england, france and germany, peuchen was often abroad. crossing on titanic was to be his fortieth transatlantic voyage. the only misgiving he had about sailing on titanic was captain smith. peuchen thought smith too old for the job and was aware of smith's chequered career. when peuchen learned smith was captain, he complained, ""surely not that man!""  peuchen, boarded the titanic at southampton as a first class passenger (ticket number 113786, £30 10s), he occupied cabin c-104.  on the night titanic sank he sat down to dinner in the first class dining room with harry molson and hudson and bess allison. later that evening peuchen learned from steward james johnson that the ship had struck a berg, but he never believed the ship was going to sink. he grabbed three oranges and a pearl pin from his cabin, but left behind $200,000 in stocks and bonds, his jewelry, and the presents he had bought for his children.  as lifeboat 6 was being lowered, peuchen noticed it was leaving poorly manned. number 6 had already begun its descent when quartermaster robert hichens, who was in the boat, shouted for help. peuchen stepped forward and told second officer lightoller he was a yachtsman. captain smith, standing nearby, suggested peuchen go down one flight and break a window on the promenade deck to get into the boat. but lightoller replied that if peuchen was as good a sailor as he claimed to be he could slip down the ropes to get into the boat. so peuchen grabbed a rope, swung himself off the ship, and hand under hand slithered down 25 feet of rope into the boat. peuchen said later he did not realize titanic was going to founder until he saw it from the lifeboat.  peuchen's conduct in lifeboat 6 came under almost as much scrutiny as that of quartermaster hichens. some critics found it odd that peuchen, a military officer, would allow hichens to carry on the way he did. but peuchen, as a yachtsman himself, may have adopted the view that to second guess an officer in charge would be to invite mutiny. peuchen was also criticised for exagerrating his own efforts and failing to acknowledge the pivotal role of ""molly brown"", who provided much more leadership in the lifeboat. it was reported that peuchen had even complained of tiredness and refused to row until goaded by mrs brown.  critics noted that peuchen was at great pains to discredit captain smith when he was interviewed by the media in new york but tempered much of his criticism at the u.s. senate inquiry, at which he was the only canadian to testify. however, peuchen was vehement in his indictment of the seamanship aboard titanic. ""they seemed to be short of sailors around the lifeboats,"" he testified, ""i imagine this crew is what we would call in yachting terms as scratch crew, brought from different vessels. they might be the best, but they were not accustomed to working together.""  in toronto peuchen was maligned as a coward, partly because he appeared to be too self satisfied. the toronto mail suspected his motives: ""he put himself in the position of a man who had to defend himself before the necessity for the defence was apparent."" one taunt about him that circulated was ""he said he was a yachtsman so he could get off the titanic, and if there had been a fire, he would have said he was a fireman.""  with all the adverse publicity, there was speculation that he might never receive his expected promotion to lieutenant-colonel in the queen's own rifles but the promotion was eventually made on 21 may 1912, he was also awarded the officer's long service decoration.  when world war i began, major peuchen retired as head of standard chemical to command the home battalion of the queen's own.  in 1920, peuchen and the mclaren lumber company began working on a dam project along the oldman river, in southwest alberta. however, that project was never completed, due to winter ice flow delays, then decreases in the price of lumber, then cost overruns. correspondence was sent to arthur peuchen through august 1930. the dam project was apparently abandoned, a sign of financial woes that affected arthur peuchen.

''then i heard shouts and the sounds of general confusion on the deck, and determined to at least see what was being done for myself. without a moment's further hesitation i rushed to the upper deck, and no sooner had i got there than someone picked me up and put me into one of the lifeboats.''  			''there was already a large number of other women and children in the boat, and i had not been in it a few moments, and did not even fully understand what was the matter, when it was pushed off into darkness.''  			''that was the last i saw of the 'titanic', and i shall never see my poor father again. 		 	    the time was 1.25am, the lifeboat, number 12. it would be some 9 hours before alice was to be lifted onto the carpathia. alice was ultimately met at pier 54 in new york by her uncle who took her to his home at 700 13th street, new brighton.  a letter written by alice shortly after the disaster to an old school-friend miss may williams was subsequently published in the north devon journal:    	 		 			my dear may, 			 			i expect you have read of the awful wreck of the 'titanic', and have seen my name in the list of survivors? i expect you have. oh! i cannot tell you how dreadful it was! my darling father has perished in the wreck, and i feel almost out of my mind with grief. you know how good he was to me, so you can imagine just what i feel like. it seems almost too hard to bear, dear. 			i cannot give you a full account of everything that happened. it would take too long to tell, but i will try to describe something of it. i had gone to bed on the sunday night, but was not asleep. about a quarter to twelve we felt an awful crash - when the boat struck an iceberg - and was nearly rocked out of bed. soon after i heard the engines stop. i rung up the steward to enquire what had happened, and he said it was nothing serious, and that we could go to sleep. i did not feel satisfied. father came to my cabin, and asked if i would care to go on deck with him; so i did. we had not been there long when someone said: ''all on deck with lifebelts on.'' 			i cannot tell you, dear, how i felt in that moment! dad and i got our belts on, and i went on deck again, and then all the women and children were put into the lifeboats and lowered. i saw my dear father for the last time in this world, and i almost felt i would have liked to die with him. to see that boat sinking, and to know he was there was too terrible to think of. after drifting around for nine hours, almost frozen with the intense cold, we were rescued by the ''carpathia.''",,2nd Class Passenger,,12,English,https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/alice-phillips.html

"PITMAN, Mr Herbert John",34,Male,Crew,Belfast,1,1,0,"        mr herbert john pitman, 34, known as ""bert"", was born 20 november 1877 in the village of sutton montis, somerset, the son of henry pitman, a farmer and sarah a. pitman.  the 1881 census shows bert living in sutton road in the village of sutton montis with his widowed mother and younger sister ida m. pitman. bert was listed aged 3, his mother (aged 33) was, at the time, farming 112 acres of land. bert also had an elder brother, william henry pitman and an elder sister who subsequently became mrs w. taylor.  pitman later moved to the somerset town of castle cary.  in 1895, aged 18, bert joined the merchant navy. he received the shore part of his nautical training in the navigation department of the merchant venturers' technical college, under mr e. f. white. in may 1900 he passed the examination for second mate, in june 1902 the examination as first mate and qualified as a master mariner in august 1906.  he served a four year apprenticeship with james nourse ltd followed by five years as a deck officer. from 1904 he served one year as a deck officer with the blue anchor line on voyages between england and australia. he then moved to the shire line where he served for six months as a deck officer on their route from england to japan. he joined the white star line in about 1906 and served as fourth, third and second officer on the white star vessels dolphin , majestic and, for two months, on the oceanic 4th officer  in early 1912 toward the end of a month's holiday at home in castle cary he received a telegram from the white star marine superintendent to report to the company's liverpool office at 9 am on 26 march to collect his ticket for belfast where he was to join the titanic as third officer. he arrived in belfast at 12 noon on 27 march, where he reported to the then chief officer william murdoch .  he actually joined the ship with the other officers at 6 am on 2 april 1912 for its sea trails in belfast lough. at 8 pm that evening the trials completed titanic sailed for southampton where she arrived at berth 44 at midnight.  pitman was the only officer not in the royal naval reserve.  as the titanic left southampton at noon on 10 april 1912 third officer pitman was standing with william murdoch (now first officer) at their station, on the docking bridge, at the stern of the ship. he recalled ""...the breaking of moorings on the new york , which was caused by the backwash from our starboard propeller. we managed to get clear and proceeded to cherbourg."" the incident caused a half hour delay in their departure.  pitman's duties aboard the titanic included working out the ship's position through celestial observation, finding the deviation of the ship's compass, general supervision around the decks, looking after the quartermasters and relieving the officers on the bridge whenever necessary.  he recalled later that, while there had been boat drills in southampton for the board of trade and again in queenstown, there was no boat drill aboard the titanic on sunday, 14th. during his watch on that sunday, from 6 to 8 pm, he noted the ship making 21½ knots - ""...nothing like we expected her to do."" he also noticed, when he calculated their position on 14 april, that captain smith had delayed the northward turn toward new york by about ten miles.  this was probably in order to bring the ship further south and thus lessen the risk of meeting ice. earlier in the day pitman had noticed boxhall note ""ice"" on a slip of paper after receiving a signal from the caronia at 9 am.  at the time of the collision, pitman was in his bunk. the noise woke him - ""i thought it seemed like the ship coming to anchor"", ""the chain running over the windlass."" after walking just outside his door and finding nothing, he returned and lit a pipe. since it was near his watch, he began dressing. then fourth officer boxhall , who had been sent by captain smith to find pitman, looked in his cabin and told him there was water in the mail room. pitman asked what had happened. ""we struck an iceberg,"" was boxhall's terse reply.  presumably pitman then went to the bridge to receive orders.  he would later testify at the us senate hearings that after the impact with the iceberg, the titanic reversed her engines which brought the ship to a full standstill - by this time, past the point of collision.  pitman was ordered to report to his boat station on the starboard side of the ship immediately.  he rushed to the after end of the ship where he met sixth officer moody , who told him there was ice on the forward well deck. as pitman was returning from the well deck, he saw a group of firemen coming up with their bags of clothes. ""i said, 'what's the matter?"" and they said, 'the water is coming in our place!'"" then he looked down no. 1 hatch and saw water flowing over it. he immediately went to the boat deck and assisted in uncovering the lifeboats.  on arriving at his boat station pitman proceeded to load lifeboat 5 , he was assisting william murdoch .  when lowering the boat to the level of the deck he noticed how much of an improvement the new davits were over older models.  'i lowered no.5 boat to the level with the rail of the boat deck. a man in dressing gown said that we had better get her loaded with women and children. i said: 'i wait the commander's orders' to which he replied: 'very well'or something like that. it then dawned on me that it might be mr ismay, judging by the description i had had given me.     pitman had not had instructions to lower the boat.  like lightoller , he went to the captain to get the order.  i went to the bridge and saw captain smith and told him that i thought it was mr ismay that wanted me to get the boat away with women and children in it and he said 'go ahead; carry on.' i came along and brought in my boat. i stood in it and said: 'come along, ladies.' there was a big crowd. mr ismay helped get them along. we got the boat nearly full and i shouted out for any more ladies. none were to be seen so i allowed a few men to get into it. then i jumped on the ship again. mr murdoch said: 'you go in charge of this boat and hang around the after gangway.'     murdoch shook hands with pitman saying ""good-bye; good luck,""  pitman then said ""lower away"" and ismay took up the call swinging his arms and shouting ""lower away, lower away."" lowe who was supervising the lowering told him to ""if you'll get the hell out of the way... you want me to lower away quickly,? you'll have me drown the whole lot of them."" a chastened ismay said nothing and moved away.  after a struggle to fit the lifeboat's plug they rowed in search of the gangway murdoch had told them to wait by.  finding the doors shut pitman ordered the lifeboat pull away from the ship.  it was only an hour later and some distance away that pitman realized the titanic was sinking. ""i thought she still had about three of the compartments and still would remain afloat.""  a count of his boat showed there were two firemen, two stewards, one sailor and pitman as far as crew members, the rest were passengers. it was found that the lifeboat had biscuits and water but no light (after reaching the carpathia , pitman made a check of all the lifeboats and found there was bread and water in all of them.) in his boat, the women ""...all behaved admirably."" he also reported that the titanic did not break in two when it sank.  'the ship turned right on end and went down perpendicularly. she did not break in two. i heard a lot of people say that they heard boiler explosions, but i have my doubts about that. i do not see why the boilers would burst, because there was no steam there. they should have been stopped about two hours and a half. the fires had not been fed so there was very little steam there. from the distance i was from the ship, if it had occurred, i think i would have known it.'     he did however describe hearing four load bangs, like gunshots, emanate from the rapidly sinking ship.  pitman said he saw no one in the water from the time he left the titanic until he reached the carpathia , although he did hear ""crying, shouting, moaning.""  'as soon as the ship disappeared i said: 'now, men, we will pull toward the wreck.' everyone in my boat said it was a mad idea because we had far better save what few i had in my boat than go back to the scene of the wreck and be swamped by the crowds that were there. my boat would have accommodated a few more - about sixty in all. i turned no. 5 boat around to go in the direction from which these cries came but was dissuaded from my purpose by the passengers.'     shortly after this, they made fast to lifeboat lifeboat 7 and transferred a woman, child and two men into the other boat. then lifeboat 7 detached from lifeboat 5 .

"PODESTA, Mr Alfred John Alexander",24,Male,Crew,Southampton,0,1,0,"        mr alfred john alexander podesta, better known as john or colloquially as jack, was born at bevois road in southampton, hampshire, england on 14 september 1887.  he was the only child of giovanni podesta (b. circa 1830) and mary jane light (b. circa 1858). his father, known in england as john, was italian by birth whilst his mother was a native of bransgore, hampshire. they were married in october 1879 in south stoneham, hampshire.   what became of john's father is not known and his mother was described as a widow when they appeared on the 1891 census whilst boarding at 14 st george's place, southampton.   in 1893 mary podesta remarried to william thomas smith (1852-1902), a gas works labourer; three years previous in 1890 they had welcomed a daughter, mary.   by 1911 john podesta was still at home with his then-widowed mother, then at 21 chantry road, southampton. he was described as a fireman in the merchant service and also residing at the address was his fiancée daisy florence chives (b. 3 august 1888), a fruit packer and fellow-native of southampton.   when he signed-on to the titanic on 6 april 1912 podesta gave his address as 21 chantry road, southampton. he had transferred from the oceanic and as a fireman received monthly wages of £6.  on the morning of 10th april podesta together with his watch-mate william nutbean, fellow firemen alfred, bertram and thomas slade and trimmer penney, who lodged with the slade brothers were all still sitting in a southampton pub. podesta recalled:   i got up on the morning of april 10th and made off down to the ship for eight o'clock muster, as is the case on all sailing days, which takes about an hour. as the ship is about to sail at about twelve o'clock noon most of us firemen and trimmers go ashore again until sailing time. so off we went [with] several others i knew on my watch, which was 4 to 8. my watch-mate, whose name was william nutbean and i went off to our local public-house for a drink in the newcastle hotel. we left about eleven fifteen making our way toward the docks. having plenty of time we dropped into another pub called the grapes, meeting several more ship-mates inside. so having another drink about six of us left about ten minutes to twelve and got well into the docks and toward the vessel. with me and my mate were three brothers named slade: bertram, tom and alfred.   we were at the top of the main road and a passenger train was approaching us from another part of the docks. i heard the slades say, ""oh, let the train go by"". but me and nutbean crossed over and managed to board the liner. being a long train, by the time it passed, the slades were too late, and the gangway was down leaving them behind. so it seemed they did not have to go.    the officer in charge of the gangway heard the men call out, but knew that there were extra men waiting on board for just this opportunity and so, even though he could have waited, he ordered the gangway lowered and signed on the extras.  podesta saw the new york incident take place, and was also present on deck when john coffee deserted the ship at queenstown (in order to visit his mother.)  on 14 april  podesta and william nutbean went off duty at 8 pm and later had supper in the mess room. as they left the mess they could hear the ship's lookouts cry ""ice ahead, sir!"" podesta and nutbean then went out on deck to look around, but saw nothing. they went back inside and down to their bunkroom, where they talked together for a little while before turning in. (podesta later said that the lookouts repeated their ice warnings to the bridge several times, but to no avail.) a short time later the collision occurred podesta and nutbean tried unsuccessfully to get other crewmen out of bed, but soon boatswain nicholls came in and ordered everyone to their boat stations. podesta and nutbean went on deck and helped to lower lifeboat 7. later murdoch told the two men to lower themselves down the falls into a lifeboat (? lifeboat 3, after which he ordered the boat to remain close by in case it had to return to the ship. the boat was 500 yards from the ship when she went down. the boat was later picked up by the carpathia, and podesta and nutbean did their best to help revive some of their half-frozen mates. the surviving crewmen later returned to england on the lapland.  john podesta resided in southampton for the rest of his life. in 1913 he and daisy florence chives were wed, later settling at 5 marine parade, chapel, southampton. the couple would have no children.  podesta continued serving at sea; following the outbreak of war in europe, in august 1914 he volunteered for merchant war service and served aboard the ships hmh salta and hmh st andrew. he also served aboard transport ships hmt campanello and hmt devon in several dangerous theatres of war including the evacuation of gallipoli. he was aboard hmt ariosto when she was engaged with an enemy submarine. he was described as standing at 5' 6"" and with auburn hair, blue eyes and a fair complexion and also had tattoos on the back of both hands.   during the war podesta found himself at odds with maritime law: in january 1915 he and six other firemen were charged with neglect of their duties and impeding the journey of the troopship (unidentified) they were serving aboard. the ship's master, captain roberts, stated that the men were due to join the ship in southampton one afternoon but none arrived on time. one arrived late and another two even later than that, one of them being intoxicated. the seven men were sentenced to twelve weeks hard labour.   despite this setback, podesta was demobilised in march 1920 and garnered the general service and mercantile marine war medals.   he later left the sea but continued to work in the docks as a fitter's mate; by 1939 he and his wife mabel were residing at 27 paget street, southampton. he retired from his final job at camper & nicholson's of northam in southampton in 1958 aged 70 and enjoyed a few years of rest with his wife mabel until her death in 1964.

(b. 1903).  	he first appears on the 1881 census as a 1 month-old infant living with his family at castelmans yard in alverstoke, the home address of his paternal grandmother elizabeth rowe. with family numbers swelling the rowes had their own home by the time of the 1891 census, 1 chester place, alverstoke, later moving to 16 chapel lane, gosport by the time of the 1901 census although george was absent by the time of the latter record and appeared as a member of crew (able seaman) aboard the royal naval ship vindictive, then docked in malta. he would again be absent from the family home at the time of the 1911 census which by then was 63 henry street in gosport.  	having worked as an errand boy in his youth, rowe joined the royal navy on 10 september 1895 aged just 14. described as standing at 5' 6½"" and with dark brown hair, brown eyes and a dark complexion, his first ship was the st vincent. he rose to become an able seaman and went on to serve aboard a host of other ships, including: victory iii, majestic, vernon, raleigh, duke of wellington, excellent, vindictive, firequeen i, goliath and exmouth before his final voyage from 8 may 1909 to 19 march 1910 aboard dreadnaught following which he was discharged at the rank of petty officer. he then joined the merchant service and began work with the white star line and served aboard majestic and oceanic.  	rowe joined the titanic in belfast for her delivery trip and served aboard as lookout. when he signed-on again in southampton, this time as quartermaster, on 6 april 1912 he gave his address as 63 henry street, gosport, hampshire. his monthly wages were £5.  	at the time of the collision rowe had been on duty at the poop deck since 8pm. describing the night as fine, he felt a slight jar and immediately looked at his watch, noting the time as 11.40pm. he then glanced to the starboard side of the ship and saw a mass of ice pass by, which he estimated to be 100 ft in height and so close to the ship that he feared the aft-bridge, which stood proud of the railing, would strike it.  	he remained at his post by the telephone to await further orders but no instructions were relayed and at 00.25 am he noticed a lifeboat in the water off the starboard side. he immediately rang up to the bridge and asked the person who answered if they were aware that a boat had been lowered; the person on the other end of the line responded by asking if rowe was the third officer but he confirmed his identity as a quartermaster and was then asked to bring rockets to the bridge for firing.  	doing as instructed rowe carried flares to the bridge where he was met by 4th officer boxhall; the pair began firing off the rockets until what rowe estimated to be 1.25am and he also sent morse code on the ship's bridge lights; he noted that at this time the crew had begun working on releasing the forward starboard collapsible lifeboats. chief officer wilde found himself in need of a seaman and rowe asked captain smith if he should continue firing off the flares; smith ordered him to stop and help man collapsible c.  	rowe seemingly arrived quite late in collapsible c's preparation as he only had time to help about six women and children into the boat before the order was given to lower away. just before lowering wilde called out for more women and children but none came forward and rowe noted how two male passengers then climbed into the stern of the boat, without invitation, before it was finally lowered. filled with what rowe initially estimated to be 39 persons which included himself, three firemen and one steward, two male passengers and the rest women and children, later on in proceedings four interlopers revealed themselves who rowe described as filipinos who had been hiding in the bottom of the boat; he later identified one of the men who climbed in just before lowering as ismay. through media at the time he became aware that the second man was william carter.  	the descent to the water, although by now only a short distance, was fraught with difficulties and took longer than expected; a 5-6° list to port meant that collapsible c hung so far in that her gunwale was catching upon rivets and any other protuberances on the side of the ship; oars and occupants' bare hands were used to try and push the boat away from the side of the ship to aid her flight. upon touching down on the water rowe stated that the forward well-deck was then awash but the forecastle head had not fully submerged.  	he saw a white light approximately five miles away just a few degrees off the port bow of titanic, which he took to be the stern light of sailing ship, but despite the efforts of those in the boat pulling towards it they made no headway. instead they altered their course and headed towards a lifeboat they could see which was carrying a green lantern.  	rowe estimated collapsible c was about three quarters of a mile away when the ship plunged and he recalled hearing rumblings like ""a distant thunder."" from the lifeboat's position at the time rowe was unable to confirm if the ship had broke up during the sinking.  	in the wake of the disaster rowe was called to testify at both the us and british inquiries into the sinking.  	following the disaster george returned to sea;

""i stood on the titanic and kept cool, although she was sinking fast. she had gone down about forty feet by now. the last boat was about being rowed away when i thought in a second if i could only pass out [i.e. get into the boat] i'd be all right. i had a towel round my neck. i just threw this over my head and left it hang in the back. i wore my waterproof overcoat. i then walked very stiff past the officers, who had declared they'd shoot the first man that dare pass out. they didn't notice me. they thought i was a woman. i grasped a girl who was standing by in despair, and jumped with her thirty feet into the boat.""  edward may have been the man whom officer lowe pitched violently into another lifeboat during the operation to empty lifeboat 14 of its passengers and distribute them to other boats, discovering a much too agile occupant too eager to slip pass undetected. once safe edward discovered that he still had his pipe with him and made a search for tobacco in his trouser pockets, managing to pull together a few scraps that he was able to light, much to the chagrin of a first-class lady in the boat who asked him to stop smoking, she perhaps thinking that he was acting too unconcernedly. recalling that exchange in later years, edward admitted that he was ""scared stiff"" at the time. he took to an oar and rowed throughout the night, although he later stated that they spent more time drifting than actually rowing.  arriving in new york aboard carpathia ryan was described as a 24-year-old chauffeur and gave his destination as the home of his sister bridget in troy. after spending time in hospital for recuperation he travelled to troy with fellow irish survivor bridget moran, both arriving on the evening of 21 april 1912 and he immediately going to the home of his sister at eagle mills in that city.   following the disaster, edward lived in new york but would only spend the next three years there. he later returned to ireland before settling in hull, yorkshire, england in 1916 where he worked as a fitter for the engineering firm rose, downs and thompson ltd and later again for ideal standard ltd.  he was married in 1916 to gertrude annie glave (b. 6 january 1887 in newington, hull), daughter of gardener william glave and the former kate hoyland.   edward and gertrude had three children: norman frederick (b. 31 january 1917), monica (b. 21 january 1923) and kathleen (b. august 1924, later mrs william meek). by 1939 the family were living at clifton terrace in beverley and edward was described as an engine fitter.    edward aged 81 (circa 1969)  during the 1950s and with the renewed hype around the titanic disaster edward got the chance to become reacquainted with several other survivors and he was a special guest at a screening of a night to remember in 1958.  ",General Labourer,3rd Class Passenger,,14,Irish,https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/edward-ryan.html

"SHELLEY, Mrs Imanita Parrish",24,Female,C2,Southampton,1,1,26,"        mrs imanita parrish shelley was born on 2 july 1886,1 reportedly in lexington, kentucky.2   she was the daughter of samuel edward parrish, a farmer, and lutie davis temple; her parents were also from kentucky and had married in the 1870s. it is not certain if imanita was the natural child of lutie and samuel and there is a possibility she was adopted.   listed as mamie parrish, she was married to william h. shelley (b. circa 1876), in salt lake city, utah on 28 june 1909. shelley hailed from louisville, kentucky but little else is known about him and he and imanita had no children.  she and her mother appear on the 1910 census a residents of an unspecified address in salt lake city along with her adoptive brother jack huntington hall (b. 1881), an electrical house superintendent her husband was not listed and his whereabouts are uncertain. imanita, her husband mother seemingly moved to butte, montana around the latter half of 1911 before she and her husband relocated to deer lodge, montana around the start of 1912.  she and her mother left for england around february 1912 and for their return to the usa the pair boarded the titanic at southampton as second class passengers ( ticket number 230433 which cost £26).  when they boarded the ship, having purchased what they termed ""the best second-class accommodation,"" they were led instead to a small cabin deep down in the ship, which was so small that they called it a cell. the ladies sent the stewardess to the purser demanding a transfer to better accommodation. his reply was that he could do nothing until the ship left queenstown, ireland when he would check tickets to see if there was any mistake. she wrote a note to the purser, explaining that she was ill, and reminding him that she had paid for better accommodations. the result was the arrival of 4 stewards who carried her to her new room. she later asked the stewardess what the purser had said on reading the note, to which the stewardess replied: ""he asked first if you were really so very sick, to which i answered there was no doubt about that."" following her transfer to the new cabin second-class physician, dr simpson, called on her three to four times a day and ordered her to remain in her cabin.  on the evening of the 14 april the temperature had fallen considerably. at the time of the collision imanita and her mother were awakened out of sleep by the shock, and especially by the stopping of the engines. the ladies heard excited voices outside in the passage, saying that an iceberg had been run into. they called for a steward and upon his arrival were told that all was well and for all passengers to go back to bed. a while later a steward came down the passage calling ""all on deck with lifebelts on."" he brought both mrs parrish and mrs shelley each a lifebelt and showed them how to tie them on, then told them to go up to the boat deck.  mrs shelley claimed that mr isidor and mrs straus, who had known of her being ill, helped them to the upper deck, where they found a chair for her to sit. the ladies made their way to lifeboat 12. the ladies found the boat was some few feet away from the ship and so deckhands roughly tossed mrs parrish in whilst mrs shelley jumped and landed safely. upon reaching the water the falls would not slacken, forcing the ropes had to be cut. after reaching the water, the lifeboat pulled out away from the ship, fearful of suction as titanic went down. they rowed out about 100 yards when a loud explosion or noise was heard, followed closely by another, and the vessel began sinking rapidly.  during the morning, boat 12 was one of the two which rescued those who had been forced to stand on the overturned collapsible b. the lifeboat was later picked up by the carpathia, sometime just after 8 am.  mrs shelley formerly a resident of butte l. manta shelley (sic) of deer lodge, who is reported to have been among the passengers of the ill-fated titanic, was the wife of w. h. shelly, resident of butte for several months, mr and mrs shelly leaving here about three months ago for deer lodge. while in butte they lived at the lenox hotel, coming here from salt lake to start an abstract business. when she left for england two months ago she spent a few days in butte and informed several friends that she would return to montana in april. she was accompanied by her mother, mrs parrish of deer lodge. the name given in the list of second-class passengers is l. manta shelly. (the anaconda standard (montana), 12 april 1912)  on board of the carpathia mrs shelley tried to sent a telegram to her husband in deer lodge. it was never transmitted because of the backlog and mrs shelley later raised the fact that she was still charged despite this(!).  william shelley, deer lodge, montana mother i safe, titanic sank midnight. board carpathia. land new york wednesday thursday  mrs shelley gave an affidavit to the u.s. senate inquiry, dated 15 may 1912.  imanita and her mother, despite their ordeals on titanic, remained avid travellers and frequently sailed between california and honolulu, hawaii where they eventually settled sometime prior to 1920. in january 1919, when she and her mother arrived in honolulu aboard manoa, having sailed from san francisco, their residence was given as cheyenne, wyoming. the 1920 census shows samuel parrish and william shelley as lodgers at an address in honolulu, both having no stated profession and with their wives notably absent, presumably globetrotting; curiously both men described themselves as widowers.   perhaps around the same time, but this is unclear, the marriage between imanita and her husband william shelley ended. the reasons for which are unknown and what eventually became of william shelley is not certain. she was remarried to a person of very close acquaintance, jack huntington hall.  jack huntington hall was born in lexington, kentucky3 on 2 october 1881, the son of l. d. hall and victoria holcomb, both english4. at the time of his draft registration in 1917/1918 he was working as an electrician in cheyenne, wyoming and gave his nearest relatives as mrs l. d. parrish who lived at an address in cheyenne. he and imanita were married in manila in the philippines on 6 december 1923.   the newly-married couple, including imanita's mother lutie, returned to the usa and arrived in honolulu in january 1924 aboard tenyo maru; in february 1925 they sailed from los angeles to honolulu aboard calawaii and in september 1927 they arrived in seattle, washington aboard niagra, having travelled from sydney, australia and at the time their address was specified as ewa, hawaii.  the 1930 census shows imanita, her husband and mother as residents of 22 ewa plantation; jack was described as an electrician in a sugar mill and imanita and her mother were described as being of british-english birth. later that same year imanita made another trip to san francisco and returned to honolulu aboard maui in october.  following the death of her mother lutie in 1930 imanita and jack eventually returned to mainland usa and settled in sonora in tuolumne county, california around 1942, being present there at the time of jack's 1942 draft registration.  ",,2nd Class Passenger,,12,American,https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/imanita-parrish-shelley.html

""our lifeboat, with thirty-six in it, began lowering to the sea. this was done amid the greatest confusion. rough seamen all giving different orders. no officer aboard. as only one side of the ropes worked, the lifeboat at one time was in such a position that it seemed we must capsize in mid-air”.  “at last the ropes worked together, and we drew nearer and nearer the black, oily water. the first touch of our lifeboat on that black sea came to me as a last good-bye to life, and so we put off – a tiny boat on a great sea – rowed away from what had been a safe home for five days"".  ""the first wish on the part of all was to stay near the titanic. we all felt so much safer near the ship. surely such a vessel could not sink. i thought the danger must be exaggerated, and we could all be taken aboard again. but surely the outline of that great, good ship was growing less. the bow of the boat was getting black. light after light was disappearing, and now those rough seamen put to their oars and we were told to hunt under seats, any place, anywhere, for a lantern, a light of any kind. every place was empty. there was no water – no stimulant of any kind. not a biscuit – nothing to keep us alive had we drifted long…   rescued in lifeboat 3 with mrs graham and margaret, miss shutes sat next to mrs clara hays and her daughter mrs orian davidson.  from the boat elizabeth watched a shooting star. it reminded of the time she left japan at night. she begged two women in the boat to stop smoking but they would not.

""is it as serious as all that?"" asked mr taussig.

""then the boat swung out from the deck. i was still with my husband, and ruth had already disappeared below the deck. i gave a great cry---i remember perfectly calling out the name of my daughter---and two men tore me from my husband's side, lifted me, one by the head and one by the feet, and dropped me over the side of the deck into the lowering boat. i struck on the back of my head, but i had furs on, and that fact probably saved me from greater injury.  ""the terrible thing was that we had so much room left for the poor men who were snatched away. when we got to the water the four stewards who had told the captain they could row couldn't row at all. there was only one seaman to command the boat and an english woman whose name i cannot now remember took an oar and rowed until we were half a mile from the titanic. my daughter also had furs on. the sailor took them from her. you'll not need them,’ he said, and we never saw them again....""  mrs taussig and her daughter escaped in lifeboat 8. following her arrival in new york tillie stayed with her father, herman mandelbaum at 1,229 park avenue.  five months after the disaster, while administering her late husband's estate, mrs taussig found some shares which had, hitherto, been thought worthless. mrs taussig sold the shares, for the engelhardt collapsible lifeboat company, for $2000.  tillie was remarried on 14 february 1920 to morris samuel (b. 11 november 1863), a clothing merchant and widower originally from rochester, new york, and they resided in manhattan. by 1921 the couple were residents of 305 west end avenue, later moving to 270 park avenue by the middle of the decade. from the latter part of the 1920s into the late 1930s, it seems that they were permanent inhabitants of the savoy hotel on 5th avenue. by the time of the 1940 census, they were living at east 58th street.  morris and tillie were avid globe trekkers, visiting many destinations including france, belgium, switzerland, austria, germany, hawaii, palestine, egypt, gibraltar, monaco, italy, greece, algeria, turkey, spain, tunisia and portugal. they appeared on passenger lists for ships such as: aquitania, mauretania, berengaria, ile de france, matsonia, maui, normandie and leviathan.  tillie was made a widow for a second time on 2 august 1948. she herself passed away in manhattan on 17 june 1957 aged 84.  she is buried in the samuel family mausoleum in mount pleasant cemetery, hawthorne, new york.

after doing which he went to one of the corridors and returned in a very few minutes with a piece of ice, saying it had been handed him as a souvenir. by that time i had dressed and had laid out the lifebelts but mr. warren said there was absolutely no danger and that with her watertight compartments the vessel could not possibly sink and that in all probability the only effect of the accident would be the delaying of our arrival in new york three or four days. we felt, however, too restless to remain in our room, so went out in the corridor again and talked with both the employees of the vessel and passengers. the general opinion prevailing was, that there was no danger except for the expression on the part of one man who stated that the water was coming in below forward.  whilst waiting in the corridors the warrens spotted one of the h&w guarantee group rushing past towards the stairs, electrician, william henry marsh parr (misidentifying him as mr perry) and they asked him for an explanation of what was happening. he didn't reply and brushed past. the warren's continued to wait around the staircase, for what mrs warren thought was around 45 minutes, when a steward came and asked them to put on their lifebelts and head topside. they returned to their cabin to fetch their lifejackets  and ascended to the boat deck where they encountered the astors and helene østby, the latter who had become separated from her father. the group remained together but mrs warren said that the astors later went inside and she never saw them again that night.  beckoned towards one of the lifeboats (boat 5), mrs warren stepped into thr craft and expected her husband to follow. when she looked around, despite the dark, she saw him assisting other ladies into the boat. she never saw him again. her lifeboat's descent to the ocean she described as dropping down at the bow, then the stern, and vice versa and she recalled looking through portholes as her lifeboat settled in the water. she described the ship settling by the head and with a pronounced list to starboard.

by 1897 the weikman family had moved to palmyra, burlington county, new jersey. in july of that year, “augustus weikman arrived home from an ocean voyage on wednesday afternoon.” in 1898 it was reported that:  palmyra. oct. 29- mrs. augustus weikman and family have been spending the week with her mother in philadelphia.” on 18 february 1900 it was reported: mr. augustus weikman arrived on wednesday from his trip to europe.”  on 6 june 1900, the couple and four children - edward c., frank s., helen m., and augustus h. - lived at 521 leconey avenue in palmyra. they owned their home. augustus was working as a barber. the two oldest boys were attending school. in 1905, augustus and mary and their four children - charles, frances, helen, and augustus - were listed as living in burlington county.  on 15 april 1910, augustus and mary, along with their four children - edward c., frank s., helen m., and a. harry - lived at 531 leconey street in palymra.  they owned their home. augustus was working as a barber on a steamship. son edward was a rug salesman and son frank was a wool broker.  augustus was listed at ivy bank, dyer road, shirley in the household of mrs. daysh in the 1911 english census. mrs. daysh took in boarders and another man, william thomas hughes, would later be the assistant 2nd steward on the titanic.  the weikmans raised registered pomeranian puppies sired by nippers wee boy, offering them for sale cheap in february 1912 from their home in palmyra.  augustus signed on to be the titanic’s barber on 4 april 1912, his previous ship the olympic. he gave his address as at mrs. daysh’s home at ivy bank, dyer road in southampton. he thought he had made more than 700 trips (in some accounts he said 705, in others 750) back and forth across the atlantic by the time he set sail. weikman sent his wife a telegram telling her his good luck at being assigned to the titanic. he was reportedly the only american crew member. he received a shilling a week and depended on tips from the first-class passengers to make his living. the barber' shop was located near the first-class entrance foyer, had two adjustable chairs, a waiting area, and also sold souvenirs to passengers. his brother william was working as a barber aboard the cedric.  when the ship struck the iceberg he was in his barber's shop reading and felt a slight jar, but it did not seem serious.  “i went forward to the steerage on ‘g’ deck and saw one of the baggage-masters [edward bessant], and he told me that water was coming in in the baggage room on the deck below."" weikman hurried up a stairway toward the deck and passed thomas andrews who told him, “my god, it’s serious,” when he asked him whether the ship was in danger. captain smith also passed by but did not answer weikman’s question.   he then proceeded along e deck to his room on c deck and then up to the main deck where he saw some ice laying about.  steward george dodd was giving the order to man the lifeboats. weikman began to help, noting that he was putting in three or four women for every man. there was a shortage of women for the first boats.  he did not board one of the boats “the lifeboats offered no opportunity for the savings of a humble barber.” he worked alongside bruce ismay, who was wearing his pyjamas and was barefoot. after launching several lifeboats “he came to the conclusion that it was not necessary to spoil his new uniform so he returned to his room and put on an old suit and supplied himself with a pair of gloves.” he returned on deck and as the last boat was being launched, saw ismay and mr. carter climb in collapsible c “there were no women in the vicinity of the boat.”  augustus then began to help to get loose one of the two remaining collapsible lifeboats, almost certainly collapsible a, the men attempting to pull up the sides. he claimed that john jacob astor and george widener were standing nearby. suddenly the bow dipped under. he and many others were “hurled into a jumble in the centre of the boat. i was covered with ropes, timbers, and chains [probably chairs] and while endeavouring to extricate myself could hear the shrieks, yells and moans of the dying. finally, i got loose except for a rope fastened around my foot. this gave me considerable trouble, but i finally got free and began to swim away from the ship.” he got about 15 feet away and the second of two explosions occurred and he thought he was thrown about 100 feet away. nearby in the frigid water was a cluster of about one dozen deck chairs tied together and he climbed aboard. he looked back at the titanic and saw the stern portion of the ship standing on end and slowly sinking downwards.  after the ship went under, with no noticeable suction, he scanned the area and saw a lifeboat about 600 feet away. the chair raft was not large enough and left his legs and feet in the water. he realized the lifeboat offered a better chance for survival and paddled himself over to the boat, which he found contained very few people. some of the men who clutched the side of the collapsible were already dead from exposure. he clambered aboard and stood in the water-filled boat. he thought that about 17 of the 28 people on the lifeboat were still alive when the carpathia arrived and that he was nearly “all in.”  he was taken aboard the carpathia, only partly conscious, and awoke in the steerage dining room, surrounded by people who didn’t speak english. “and it was found that his feet had been frozen and he is still in danger of being maimed for life.” he was still wearing a vest and when he explored its pockets he found a one-dollar bill. ‘that he determined to keep as a souvenir of the terrible experience he had endured.” he also had a gold pocket watch that had stopped at 1:50.  weikman’s name was not on the initial lists of survivors and it was not until wednesday, april 17, that the family received a telegram. it was reported after the disaster that:  one of the survivors of the titanic disaster is augustus h. weikman, ship’s barber. he is a resident of palmyra, near mount holly, n.j., and is one of the largest property owners of the town. relatives and neighbors were condoling with mrs. weikman yesterday when a message was received from her husband by way of halifax that he was safe. weikman has been a barber for 20 years on the white star line and when the titanic was put on line he was given the post of ship’s barber by reason of his seniority of service.  weikman was interviewed by the trenton evening times upon his arrival in new york city.  “weikman showed the effects of the terrible experiences through which he had just passed, and at time his talk was almost incoherent. he was unable to leave the chair and was wheeled from the waiting room to the train that leaves the terminal at 1 o’clock.” he would later state that he thought the lifeboats that had been launched could have returned and picked up more passengers. aboard the train heading to camden, new jersey, he told of his adventure to interested travelers. when he arrived at the train station, a push cart was used to take him home since he could not walk.  weikman prepared an affidavit in may 1912 in which he claimed that “j. bruce ismay was justified in leaving the titanic when he did because there were no more women in the vicinity ‘when he was ordered into the boat by the officer in charge.” he was honored a few days later by being made an honorary member of washington camp, no. 23 p.o.s. of a.  he was walking with crutches when he attended the event. he gave another talk at the camden lodge of elks in which he told of his experiences and blamed the accident on the wireless company.  in july 1912, he heard that mrs. john hays hammond was raising money for a titanic memorial and he wrote her a letter in which he told of his experiences. he sent along the dollar bill from his vest pocket.  augustus was offered the position of “admiral’s barber” on the olympic in august 1912 and expected to return to work after he had recovered from his injuries. he ended up sailing aboard the lusitania instead. he registered as an american citizen in southampton on 6 november 1914, using his seaman’s discharge book as evidence of his citizenship. he resigned as barber, perhaps in early 1915, after german submarines started to target ships in the atlantic ocean. by 1917, augustus was living at 109 broad street in palymra. his son augustus, jr. was living with while working as a farmer.  on 15 january 1920, augustus and mary and their children helen and harry lived at 109 broad street in palmyra. they owned their home.  he worked as a merchant while daughter helen was a milliner and son harry was a laborer at a watch case company.

"WHEAT, Mr Joseph Thomas",30,Male,Crew,Belfast,1,1,0,"          mr joseph thomas wheat (assistant second steward) was born in rock ferry, cheshire, england on 13 april 1882.   he was the son of william wheat (1849-1908), a seaman, and mary jane oldham (1850-1942). his parents were from gainsborough, lincolnshire and runcorn, cheshire, respectively and they married in birkenhead in 1872. his father served as the mate of a tug boat in the harbour service.   one of eight children, his siblings were: marion (b. 1874), alice (b. 1877), william john (b. 1876), james henry (b. 1879), florence jane (b. 1884), charles edwin (b. 1887) and elizabeth ellen (b. 1890).   in the year prior to joseph's birth his family were recorded on the 1881 census living at 5 wellington street in tranmere, cheshire. when joseph appears on the 1891 census the family were living at 9 medway road, tranmere. the 1901 census shows wheat's mother and younger siblings living at 22 mulberry road, tranmere but joseph was not present, presumably having already commenced his career at sea. by march 1904 he was serving as a steward aboard the cedric and gave his local address as 28 grove road, rock ferry.  wheat was married on the isle of wight, hampshire in late 1911 to ellen gertrude whiteley (b. 17 may 1884), a laundress originally from halifax, yorkshire. the two had lived together as boarders and show up at 12 queens park terrace, southampton on the 1911 census.  wheat was on board the titanic for her delivery trip from belfast to southampton. when he signed-on again in southampton, on 4 april 1912 he gave his address as 14 cobden gardens, southampton. his previous ship had been the olympic and as assistant second steward he received monthly wages of £8. his cabin was situated amidships on f-deck portside, close to the turkish baths, and he shared a cabin with another steward.  on the night of 14 april wheat was just about to turn in for the night when he heard a noise which he believed was the ship dropping a propeller blade, having been aboard another vessel when that same anomaly occurred. it is not clear where wheat was situated at the time but he reportedly roused his bunkmate who had seemingly slept through the impact. the two went one deck above to e-deck where they met steward james johnston who informed wheat that the ship was taking in water forward. wheat and his colleague went forward to investigate for themselves and went to the post office on g-deck where he witnessed the mail workers dragging the mailbags up from below, water already rising up the companionway between the mailroom on the orlop deck to g-deck by that point.     after observing this wheat ascended back up to scotland road and headed amidships where he then returned to f-deck. on his own volition and without orders he began manually closing the two watertight doors in that section of the ship that housed the turkish baths and his own cabin. second steward george dodd and turkish bath attendant john crosbie helped him with this task.   task completed wheat began an ascent to the upper decks; at c-deck he encountered purser herbert mcelroy who was hanging over the banister to address him, ordering him to ""get the men up and get all lifebelts and all passengers."" wheat complied and descended back to the stewards' but found most of the stewards were already prepared. he then returned to his own cabin and took time to ensure everyone in that f-deck compartment were out of their rooms; the area was abandoned. making his way back to the staircase that could lead him up to e-deck, wheat noticed that water was already trickling down the companionway from the deck above; he ascended to e-deck and noticed water beginning to inundate the starboard portion of that deck, the first class cabin areas. he went out the emergency door to scotland road which he noted was ""quite dry"" and saw only a handful of male steerage passengers making their way aft, several carrying or dragging luggage and boxes. wheat then made for a service staircase and ascended to b-deck where he encountered chief steward andrew latimer who was dressed in his great coat and with a life preserver over the top. wheat offered up the advice to his superior to put the lifebelt on under his coat, but offered no explanation as to whether latimer followed his advice.   wheat then pressed on and made his way to the aft-starboard boat deck where he observed that lifeboat 9 was being prepared to loading and with women and children being herded by stewards across from the portside. wheat then received orders from first officer william murdoch to take a contingent of stewards (around 70 in total) down to a-deck, the officer hoping that the aft starboard boats could be filled from there. wheat took his stewards down and lined them up two-deep along the a-deck railing, fearing a rush but found the evacuation in that section of the ship to have been quite orderly. he shouted out orders for someone to check that the plug of boat 11 was in place and ordered five or six stewards to man the boat; with one foot on the railing and another in the lifeboat he helped fill that boat with women and children until it reached capacity. murdoch peered over the side from the boat deck and barked ""you have got enough there."" wheat testified that there were fifty-one women, three men, nine children, seven stewards, two sailors, one fireman and himself, making a total of 74 occupants. lifeboat 11 was one of the most crowded to be launched.   following launch wheat discovered that lifeboat 11 was bereft of certain items such as lamps or compasses but did have a supply of water.  joseph wheat survived the sinking and he and his lifeboat were later rescued by the carpathia. he was not required to give evidence to the american inquiry into the sinking but gave evidence to the british inquiry over two days and was recompensed with £16, 2s, 6d.   his wife had been pregnant at the time of the sinking and she gave birth to a son on 29 november 1912, john joseph william who was to be their only child.  wheat continued to work at sea for the duration of world war i and in the 1920s later served aboard a number of ships, including aboard the belgenland in the early part of that decade. he later left the sea to take up land-based catering work.   the wheat family later resettled in kent and appear on the 1939 register as residents of 70 tower coast crescent in orpington; joseph was described as a catering superintendent and also living with them was his mother-in-law betty whitely. he would live at that address for the rest of his life.  ",Assistant Second Steward,Victualling Crew,,11,English,https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/joseph-thomas-wheat.html

"ḤANNā, Mr Mubārik Sulaymān Abī Āsī",27,Male,C3,Cherbourg,0,1,7,"         mr mubārik sulaymān abī āsī ḥannā (hanna moubarak; bert johns) was born in hardīn, syria (now lebanon) on 10 april 1885. he was the son of john simeon āsī and mary anthony 1 and had four known siblings 2: simon (b. 1884), alex (b. 1888), rose (b. 1892) and minnie (b. 1893).  mr ḥannā, a farmhand in his native lebanon, boarded the titanic at cherbourg as a third class passenger (ticket number 2663 which cost £7, 4s, 7d) and was travelling with a large group from hardīn, including several cousins. other members of the group included mr and mrs antūn yazbak; mrs amīnah mubārik and her sons; thamīn tannūs and būlus ḥannā-dīb, among others.  he was headed to port huron, michigan to the home of hanna āsī (hassey), 1119 11th avenue. at least two siblings had already crossed the atlantic, with his brother simon living in michigan (reportedly port huron) since 1906. a sister, rose (mrs peter simon) had emigrated in 1911 and lived in pennsylvania.  on the night of the sinking mubārik was asleep in his cabin and seemingly slept through the impact. a cousin woke him, telling him that she ship had shuddered and was now sinking. hurriedly dressing and stuffing his bare feet into shoes, mubārik left his few possessions and what money he had and  hastened from his cabin.  knowing very little english, ḥannā managed to scale his way to the upper decks, noting that the sea was calm and the air very cool. around him people were shouting and he also witnessed a large number of people in prayer.  accounts of how ḥannā survived vary. one account states that he stepped into a lifeboat that was almost already full, seemingly without much opposition (believed to have been lifeboat 15). another account (from the times herald, 1938) gave him a much more dramatic exit:  ""i tried to get into the first lifeboat they lowered, but the crew and officers beat me and knocked me back. the same thing happened with the second boat. i saw a woman with a baby in her arms. she was screaming for help--for someone to save her baby. i took it and pushed my way to the rail and help the mother and baby get on the lifeboat...   a rich man was offering large sums of money to get saved. many people were drinking to make the last moments of their lives easier to bear... i was afraid, i didn't know what to do. i prayed to the lord and decided to take a chance. i jumped 30 feet in the direction of the lifeboat, which was filled with 30 women and children. someone shot at me and the bullet grazed the back of my head...   i landed on the head of a woman in the boat; there was only one other man in it. he was rowing. the man tried to put me out but i held on to the seat.  an american woman spoke to the man. he let go of me and let me stay there. just after i got into the boat, another man came swimming toward us. the man in our boat shot him right in the middle of the forehead as he put his hand up to grasp the side of the boat.""  in new york he was reportedly met by a brother who had travelled from port huron to meet him. following treatment in st vincent's hospital he would travel to wilkes-barre, pennsylvania with thamīn tannūs and her son as'ad where he would spend time with friends and relatives before heading to michigan. whilst here he and mrs tannūs were interviewed by a local paper.  he was married in croswell, sanilac, michigan on 9 september 1912 3 to hanna hassey's daughter, elizabeth āsī (hassey) 4 (b. 23 may 1891), also a lebanese migrant, but the couple had no children. in america they were members of st stephen's catholic church and mubārik anglicised his name to bert johns 5.  bert worked for several years in industrial plants before he and his wife operated a fruit store in marlette, michigan before moving the business to quay street in port huron. for 15 years he operated a public house, bert's tavern on 622 walter street, also in port huron.  the 1930 census shows he and his wife as resident of 333 clairmont, port huron and at 218 broad street by the time of the 1940 census. bert would live on broad street for the rest of his life, later at number 216.
